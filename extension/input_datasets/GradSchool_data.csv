0,gwuv29,False,Academics,43,I [Rant] I want to be completely candid about something I’ve been hesitant to admit to myself,GradSchool,"Edit: Thank you all for commiserating with me, sending me words of encouragement, and just generally engaging in this discussion. I wrote this last night during a mini anxiety attack so my post probably came off as disorganized, whiny, entitled, and perhaps defensive. As I responded to someone below, the whole point of this was to say that I ultimately want to have a career where my work is financially valued more than it is in academia. I want my life to be about passion, and science is something I am truly passionate about. However, I am also of the opinion that at the end of the day a job is a job is a job and we should all demand to be compensated appropriately for our level of education, skill, and experience. 

.


Complete stream of consciousness below and seriously not even worth reading:

.



I love being an academic scientist in the sense that I enjoy doing the research, the hours of reading/learning that goes into it, the discussion, and generally the *idea* of being an academic. But I hate doing the fucking work. I hate it. I don’t want to do it anymore. I hate having to write, the deadlines, having to come home after a full workday and continue working on my couch at 8pm like I’m doing right now editing my prelim exam. I am just not a person who believes that your work should permeate every aspect of your life. I want the work-life balance and I want to get paid well for the work that I do. My (now ex) partner started a job as an assistant professor at a small liberal arts college last May after graduating for $50k a year. Like, wtf. I was earning that much as a research coordinator with a BA before I started my PhD. 

What I want is to work my 40-50 hours, and then go home for the weekend, smoke a bowl, and live my life without having work on my mind all the time. But most of all, I want to get paid more than what I would get paid as a professor. I can’t wait to finish my PhD in two years and dip the fuck out into government or private sector. The idea of having to put so much fucking effort into my career makes me want to vomit. 

I understand this may ruffle some feathers in a sub where a majority of its subscribers are hardworking individuals and high achievers who will probably end up in academia. But I’m done with it and I feel so liberated saying this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gwuv29/i_rant_i_want_to_be_completely_candid_about/,337,[deleted] ,2020-06-05 01:24:00

7,gi0rzh,False,Academics,23,"Failed a course, PhD program is probably done.",GradSchool,"I had a course for which I took an incomplete last semester due to family issues. I had to write a data analysis manuscript and do a presentation. A course I am in this semester uses the paper from that course usually and refines it to prepare it for publication. So basically I was working on the same manuscript for both courses at the same time. I would get feedback at each step and make revisions. 

The professor who originally gave me the incomplete has been rude and less than helpful the whole time. She hates my research area, hates that I am not a slave to research, and is overall a miserable person. She knew that if I received a C or below that I would be dismissed from the PhD program. I was given my last feedback, told to make revisions and submit the final paper. I got it back today with a D. I was also given a D on my oral presentation. The same presentation was given for my other class which I earned a 92% grade. 

I have cried several times now. Talked to my advisor who is going to meet with the professors to see what can be done. But after feeling unsure of my future as a researcher, this just really has me down. I’m good at data collection and research design. I’m great a recruitment and have a good rapport with my research population. Clinically I’m a great nurse, but I feel stifled by academic writing. I hate not being able to have original thoughts or be able to bring my clinic experience into my writing. 

Now I feel like I have wasted two years while putting myself and my family through hell. I was actually looking forward to my dissertation work because it is something I’m passionate about.

But now I’m afraid this has ruined my chances at having any future in academia or even getting into another program. Career wise I’m fine, I’m an employed nurse, I’ll always have a job. But I want to do more for my population and I can’t do that without data and credentials. 

Is there academic life after failing out of PhD program?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gi0rzh/failed_a_course_phd_program_is_probably_done/,26,"You are likely to find a whole lot of forgiveness on the other side.

>I feel stifled by academic writing. I hate not being able to have original thoughts or be able to bring my clinic experience into my writing.

This sounds like the core of your issue.  And it's the core of most PhD issues, you are by no means alone.  The question is does your school have a solid writing center that can help you with this.  They should and you should leverage them heavily.  And if you haven't been sending drafts in or peppering your professors with questions now is likely the time to start.

Even if you have to retake the course you can indeed recover from this.  Especially with a supportive advisor and chair.  You'll probably also want to put feelers out early for who will eventually be your primary dissertation support to find someone you can work with who can help with that core academic writing challenge.

I've had several students who had trouble taking off their ""advocate"" hat when writing.  You can do it. Academic writing is cold and detached.  And when you master it the skill can make all of your other writing that much stronger especially the type of writing where you can leverage your clinical experience and original thoughts.

9,gf2izp,False,Academics,27,"""You were my charity case and you still fell short.""",GradSchool,"... Is (paraphrased) the last thing one of my professors said to me.  I wanted/needed an A- in his class and he gave me a B+, and that was essentially what he said when I asked politely and nonconfrontationally if he could find it in him to bump my grade, and stated my reasoning.  

I had a really hard time this year.  It's my first year of PhD and I went straight from undergrad.  My program requires a 3.5 GPA to qualify to take the preliminary exam, and because of a difficult adjustment period last semester related largely to my existing mental health issues, ADHD/Autism, I was borderline.  I'm still borderline because my university is allowing students to either take a passing grade (S) or request a letter grade conversion in light of the pandemic and I barely made an A- in my other class.  I had been doing fine this semester until the pandemic hit and what structure I had was just ripped out from under me.

I'm just so sick of feeling like I'm not good enough and needing to exhaust myself constantly bowing and scraping and justifying to get the help and understanding I need, only for it to not even pay off in the end.  I worked so damn hard to get here, and it feels like it could all slip through my fingers at any moment with the slightest misstep.  I feel like I'm constantly letting myself and everyone else down.

You are not good enough. That's why you feel like you're not good enough. You got a B+ and thank fucking god the professor had the balls to not bump it because you demanded it.

You're cheating (asking teachers for a grade you didn't deserve with a sob story) and that affects everyone that isn't a cheater in a negative way. If you cheat your way into higher grades, that means that someone else that actually better than you will end up not getting the spot. 

Imagine what you'd feel like if you worked super hard and got that 3.5 and then you got told to fuck off because someone else fucked the professor and took your spot.

I am in a two-year MSc program in biology, having started in Sept. 2019. I want to apply for admission to PhD programs for Sept 2021, but given the COVID-19 pandemic, I am starting to worry that I won't be able to finish on time. My university suspended all lab access in March. 

I went straight from high school, to BSc to MSc without taking a gap year and finishing everything on time. I feel worried that this is the first time that I won't finish on time, and I am wondering if I should even apply to PhD programs, given this uncertainty. Unlike those who are coming from their BSc, whether I graduate depends on finishing experiments and my thesis, not on coursework.

I guess my questions are:

* Is anyone else worried about finishing on time, either for further studies or for a job?
* How to address the very real possibility that if I do get accepted to a PhD program, and I need an extra semester to wrap up my experiments and thesis, how to bring this up to the graduate school/PhD supervisor.

I came to US for masters and at first I had good hopes of learning new things. As I got here, everything was different and it took me a lot of time to figure out. Before coming here I spoke to a professor for advising and he agreed. When I got here, he said he cannot take me in his group. I was devastated at first and I approached a different professor. He also said NO. This took a huge toll on my mental health and it affected my grades in first Semester. I was under a lot of stress. Two subjects were basically PhD class with I'm the only Master student. It was really hard to cope up. i ended up with C's.

I got 1.9 in first Semester. I was placed in Academic probation. I had to get my GPA above 3 to avoid probation.

For second Semester, I studied very hard and got 3.7 GPA. Thus my cumulative GPA is 2.8. This is not enough. So in the end of one year, I'm in academic probation and no advisor yet. With the stress I'm going through, I can't think straight.

This could include campus counseling services, international student services, graduate student government, etc. They will be best able to help you navigate things at your specific school. I would also make sure you have a support network in place. This is an easy thing to forget about, but not having/using it can make the situation feel even more seeious when you can't talk about.

Next, take a moment to step back and be proud of yourself. After a rocky start, you had an amazing second semester. That is important and should be acknowledged. It is also an indication of your ability to continue succeeding in your program. 

I would personally schedule a meeting with the director of grad studies for your department. Work with then to develop a plan / road map for the upcoming year. Make sure you understand what probation means for you and continuing in the program. Many schools have very black and white cutoffs for these things, the are often from the university level rather than the department. This does not mean that faculty in your department think that you are not capable or that there is no hope. 

I've found it's easy to get overwhelmed with the big picture, and that breaking it down into smaller chunks helps me feel optimistic and motivated. et smaller objectives to help you reach your larger goals. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed about finding an advisor, first, spe d some time researching who might be a good fit. Then schedule a meeting to connect with them more. Etc.

As the title says, I have my remote defence coming up shortly. I have always semi looked forward to my in person defence since my research allows some fun things to be done.

I was also planning to bake cookies in the shape of the system I study. These things would have helped calm me down a bit I think, since I am usually a walking bundle of nerves.

I’m leaning more towards a PhD program that has comparable classes to an MS, and ideally offers an MS along the way. However, I don’t know ANYTHING about how the competition is for PhD biostatistics programs. 

I’d love any advice anyone has on how to be a competitive applicant, or some insight about what I’m up against.

As a frame of reference, I applied to statistics and biostatistics programs in the US this past fall (you can see my results in my post history) and I'll be joining a PhD program this fall. 

First, a few things about stats grad school in the US. Most PhD programs in the US allow you to Master out if you finish the first two years (all of the programs I visited had this option). Statistics and biostatistics PhD programs aren't that different (at least in the US). The main difference is that stats programs tend to be a bit more theoretical. You don't need a stats MS to be competitive for a stats PhD. A good number of successful applicants haven't taken any stats classes (I only took two). 

Second, an answer to your question. The biggest parts of a stats or biostats PhD application are letters of rec and math grades. Research experience isn't prioritized as much since undergrads usually don't do real stats research. That's not to say don't do research; it's a great  way to get great letters and learn about the field. With respect to math grades, competitive applicants usually have mostly A's in math classes. Multivariable calc, linear algebra, and real analysis are pre-reqs for most stats PhDs. Good grades in pure math classes make you more competitive. If you'd like to see some applicant profiles, look at the Mathematics and Statistics section of GradCafe. Just keep in mind that you shouldn't compare yourself too much.

This information comes from stats professors I've talked to, GradCafe, and my personal experience. I hope it helps! ",2020-05-19 23:26:11

1) enroll and begin dual-degree program concurrently, meaning two bureaucracies, two degrees at the end, but with around a 3 year complete time. This option is known for a lot of confusion/frustration plus a weekly 45 minute commute to another campus, and 12 credit hours per semester, will overlap with about 12 hours of my primary/first degree plan

First thing to understand is imposter syndrome seems practically to be a requirement for being a grad student. Seriously, everybody has it. If your lab group is not full of rude, terrible people they will not look down on you for not being as good as they are. You are certainly not going to be as good as they are at the beginning because you're just starting, that just makes sense. I struggled with this as well, and here's what helped me. Say you are the worst graduate student in the group. Who cares? Use this time and this experience to improve yourself and work on something you're interested in. You got admitted, which means that the people who's job it is to decide if someone will be a good fit, decided you would be a good fit. You demonstrated that you have the required background and ability, but grad school is more of an exercise in grit than intelligence. What's the worst case scenario? You go and you are so bad that they kick you out? You go and your lab group is really mean and sucks and you decide to drop out? (I think both are very unlikely).

Something that I was considering when I made that decision, and which keeps coming to mind now, is the difference in program set-up between PhD study in the US and in Europe. I also had an offer at an American university, and when I thought about that program, I felt confident because I knew exactly how my five years there would look - how many courses I would be taking, what my qualifying exams would entail, etc - whereas here, the PhD system is much more independent. I'll be doing a handful of courses towards the end goal of passing a state exam on 'Inorganic Chemistry' (as broad a topic as that is), and my courses are \*much\* more independent than what I've done in the past. Plus, what with coronavirus and all, exams for this semester have been postponed and I just get more and more nervous about the oral exams I'll be doing for two courses when exams do take place for this term. 

I'm wondering whether anyone else has had a similar experience in transitioning to the European PhD study system, and I'm also looking for advice I suppose, on maintaining my self-motivation to study on my own, and to in fact spend time studying, rather than doing what I would prefer to, which is 40+hrs a week of hands-on lab research.

I've posted here before, it was last semester, and basically I talked about whether or not I wanted to stay in grad school. Well, I'm still here, but having to deal with online school in pandemic has just about obliterated any energy I had for what I'm doing and I'm really at a loss for what to do right now. I'm halfway through my finals week and I'm ashamed to admit I've barely done a single thing in preparation for said finals. I don't even have ""as much"" to do, it seems, in comparison to past years, but I'm still struggling. 

I don't know what to do. The minute I entered grad school I started second guessing my quality of work and the quality of my writing, and it got so bad I felt that I couldn't finish a lot of the coursework simply out of fear. I already have an incomplete from last semester over a paper I felt really passionate about, but for some reason couldn't finish. I thought that new topics this semester would help whip me into shape and get me remotivated, but that hasn't happened. I used to love reading but I feel like my love for reading has died down and I'm struggling to read the texts for my papers. I was doing okay before pandemic, but with all the changes happening and with what's going on, I feel like what I do is not really needed.

I should probably mention that I've still been able to stay in contact with my therapist during isolation. We've worked together for a few years now and they have recently suspected I have CPTSD (not official diagnosis since pandemic and can't see a specialist but still, suspected). I think some of my behaviors / habits around school are stemming from that. Honestly, I've just been prioritizing my mental health throughout all of this but it's come at the cost of my academic career and performance. And now the fact I'm doing so poorly in school is becoming avoidable and I'm mentally about to lose it. I'm not proud of how my first year of grad school went. I honestly want to quit or maybe even defer my next year (which would be my last year of school unless I continued down PhD track, which I feel I don't even deserve anymore).  

I feel like I do need to reconsider why I want(ed) to be in grad school. I also need to get better. But we're in middle of a pandemic and of finals week and I can't help but feel this is a really bad time to bring it up to any of my supervisors or professors.

Currently I am somewhat undecided into which path I want to follow, so I wanted to ask for some advice or knowledge you can share. If I went for the molecular biology masters, would it be possible for me to link it with environmental work?

The program is the best (I do medieval history) in the state system that I am in. The professor I had a zoom meeting with yesterday seemed nice and I have a friend that goes there for similar interests who seems to tolerate it but says it is a ghost town. This university is in a place that is smaller and more isolated than my current city but is only 2 1/2 hours from where I live now and an easy drive. There is no social life there (not that I'm into partying and am aware I'll be extremely busy but I would like to have options) and the one time I visited it seemed gloomy and meh.

You can be rejected from a program, and then accepted by a far stronger program a year later. There are too many factors to be able to predict this with any sense of certainty. So if you're not crazy about it, try your luck again. ",2020-04-18 18:38:41

66,go516s,False,Academics,2,Private loan lenders for a graduate CERTIFICATE program,GradSchool,"Hi all,

Running into way too many headaches trying to find a private loan that I can take out for my graduate certificate program. I am enrolled in a graduate certificate program at Penn State (6 credits in the summer, 6 credits in the fall) and am having the worst of luck trying to find a private loan company to help pay for it. My credit rating and ability to pay for the loan is not an issue at all. FAFSA won't cover the certificate program. The issue is that very few private lenders will approve of a loan that is non-degree seeking i.e. a certificate. I had no idea this was a barrier to obtain a private loan for my schooling, but I imagine plenty of other certificate seekers have encountered this strange gray area as well.

I was approved for my loan at Sallie Mae, but didn't finalize it because of their repayments options (they were only offering 5 or 6-year repayments plans). Worst case scenario, I will go with their option, but I (and my fiancé) am still paying off our federal and Parent-PLUS loans from our undergrad degrees and I am trying to keep my monthly payments low for this certificate program.

I tried loans through College Ave and New Hampshire Higher Education with no luck. After speaking with people on the phone from those companies who said they DO give loans to non-degree seeking students, I find out via email a week later from the university that it is not the case. Just extremely frustrating. I understand why so many people just give up on the whole ""going to college"" process, because it can be very time-consuming and exhausting just trying to figure out how to pay for it.

Any recommendations for private loan lenders out there for a non-degree seeking program?

Im asking about systems or methods you all employ to take good notes/citations so I can avoid spending up to 8 hours skimming books for citations as I write the paper. 

I am currently finishing my first year of history program (M.A.) and am interested to hear how some of you keep track of your notes/research before you write your papers.

If I’m being honest, I’ve always just complied a list of sources ahead of time and leave it until a week or two before it’s due and go into a mad dash to burn through all the texts. 

Honestly, I feel dirty doing this and feel I could produce better work (my professors say they are impressed with my work despite the fact much of it is rushed) but the issue is I often work best when I wait until the last week or so.

I think this is because I really don’t have any good systems in place to retain notes on books and authors beyond when they sit within my memory.

What I typically do now is start skimming books a week or two prior to the due date of my paper. This gives me a general idea of which of the sources I’ve collected that will be most useful. Then a night or two before it’s due I’ll sit down to actually write the paper. I’m well versed in background knowledge in my field so it’s never an issue for me to pump out an introduction to the paper but then when I get to the body, largely because I don’t have a good note taking system, I skim through books again to identify sources  to cite and this can end up taking anywhere between 4-8 hours if the paper is longer than 15 pages (most of my papers are between 20-30 pages each).

Being a graduate teaching assistant is basically a training job, and when we elect to attend graduate school it is generally accepted that you will need to live very frugally, and possibly take out loans.  It's a period of optional economic disadvantage in the hopes that when it's done we will be at an advantage with our PhDs and all.  The people complaining about ""90% rent burden"" are sometimes unfortunate cases where it's all they could find, but more frequently it is people who choose to live alone.  I've lived 3 different places in Santa cruz, and the first one put me at ""70% rent burden"" so you know what I did?  I took out a 20k loan.  My peers should be ashamed of themselves. I am ashamed of being a UCSC grad myself right now. Their tactics are unfair, they got a win, considered it a loss, and then willingly and knowingly chose to be fired so they could look like martyrs.

Also, so everyone knows, they chose to block the metro buses onto campus today, like every day in the last 4 weeks, but that meant that they prevented a ton of people from voting, which is likely considering that the apathy threshold the public has toward voting at all is fairly low.  But here are the facts:

To the general public:

1). We take home $2,100 cash after taxes for a maximum of 20 hr work weeks (and the chancellor just offered 5 yrs guaranteed funding and 2.5k/yr housing supplement)

2) They are asking for an additional $1,400 gross income

3) We receive tuition remission

4) We receive excellent health care

5) We have access to emergency funds via slug support

6) We have access to free food pantries once a week which I myself have used (boohoo?)

7) We are all eligible as grads for $20k/yr in loans, which you would presumably take out if, I don't know, your circumstances were dire, or like, you had a kid

112,frfpd2,False,Academics,6,Should I do a second master's or a doctoral program?,GradSchool,"Currently a full-time grad student in education (curriculum & instruction), before I came back to school I taught third grade for several years. I'm interested in leadership, management and organizational behavior as they relate to public schools. I'm not interested in becoming a principal or superintendent, but I am very interested in helping improve leadership practices in schools/districts, improving workplace culture, etc. Ideally, after I finish school I'd work as a consultant, help shape policy, or work at a think tank. I also wouldn't mind working to develop professional development and training for companies

When I first started my master's in the fall, I had the idea that I'd do a PhD afterwards, but after a lot of reflection and talking to some professors/friends, I realized this wasn't a good idea. I'm passionate about what I'm studying, and I enjoy researching, but I'm not interested enough to sustain a 4-5 year PhD program and all the stress that comes with it. Plus, I have no interest in academia whatsoever, which renders the whole idea moot

I feel like I've got a few options, I'm just not sure which would be the best:

**Option 1**: I just go back to teaching after I finish my master's, teach for a couple of years, then see how I'm feeling and if I want to go back for another degree. This is the one I'm least excited about

**Option 2**: I could go into an EdD (Doctor of Education) program. From what I understand, these are geared towards people who want to continue working in non-academic roles, whether it's in a school/district, for a non-profit, in government, etc. This would still involve research and a dissertation, but is more about practical solutions. It would also take only three years to finish. The downside is that, for the most part, these degrees seem more intended for people who want to be principals/superintendents. While I'm sure I could find a different career, I also don't want to get into a program and then find out my non-administrator career options would be limited. On top of that, not all of these programs offer funding. Still, I found a few schools that are promising and worth looking into more

**Option 3**: I go into another master's program. One of the professors I talked to about this encouraged me to think in terms of ""return on investment"". In his words: ""If you can find a master's degree that gets you what you need and lets you finish in two years as opposed to several, why not do that? It gets you back in the workforce faster"". I was hesitant at first about getting another master's, mainly because I thought it'd look weird on my resume to have two rather than an MA and PhD/EdD, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense (and I could be wrong, but I don't think too many employers would mind what the degrees are if the skills and knowledge are there)

I'm also finding a few interesting options if I go this route. For example, [UPenn offers dual degree programs](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/dual-joint-degrees), and I'd be interested in pursuing the dual program through Wharton and the Grad School of Education there (either Education Policy or Educational Entrepreneurship), though a couple of the others are also interesting 

**Option 4**: I go back to the workforce, but do online certifications through something like Coursera or EdX. No, these aren't full fledged degrees, but they'd still teach me valuable skills, and it'd probably be the most cost/time efficient way, especially if I could get whatever district I work for to reimburse my tuition. It makes sense in a number of ways, but I'm really not big on the idea of returning to teaching

This has been on my mind a lot recently, especially since I've been spending so much time at home.

I'm currently doing my MS in mathematics(did undergrad in Physics) and I'd like to do a PhD somewhere else when I'm done. I'd like to work in Symplectic Geometry but no one at the university work in this field. I found someone who work on projective geometry but it's not really something that's interesting to me. 

In my Masters, I can do either a thesis or take 3 directed study courses. I heard that a thesis can boost my chances of getting in PhD programs later. However, if I choose the thesis track, I'd have to do it on something that's not related to Symplectic Geometry. I'm not sure if I can do a thesis about something I'm not truly interested in. On the other hand, if I do a directed study for 3 courses, I may be able to do my directed study courses on Symplectic Geometry topics.

It's simply a willpower/motivation thing. If I put a gun to your head and tell you to work, you'll work for 24 hours straight. If you have facebook open, your phone on the table with whatsapp etc. then it's never going to work.

Procrastinators usually perform in ""sprints"" where they crunch before a deadline. That is not an effective strategy long-term. You need to learn to do it every (work) day.

Behaviorism is pretty useful here. Just like you were trained to poop in the toilet instead of in your pants and perhaps trained to brush your teeth, wash your hands etc. you can train yourself to do work. Consistency and establishing a routine is key. It's a lot easier to just stick to a daily routine than try to come up with some new behavior.

I went to the army and we woke up at 06:00 every morning, had 10 minutes to put some clothes on, use the toilet and be ready to move out for food. First week was chaotic and sucked, 11 months later we'd have time to chat and mess around and browse reddit on our phones. Things like making your bed, going to eat at specific times, cleaning your barracks every day, cleaning your gun etc. just became habits that you did and didn't feel terrible anymore.

It's just habit and having done it 100 times before.

Years later and I can't wake up at 06:00 to save my life, even a little bit of pressure from a hurry turns the whole morning into a chaotic mess and I haven't made my bed for a long time and I clean my apartment maybe once in a few months.

Probability theory is an integral component of statistical research, and there will certainly be probability theorists in any strong statistics department.

However, probability isn't so broad or popular a field that it would be sensible to, for example, offer a full master's degree in just probability.

In terms for how to proceed, *not all programs are created equal* and you are just going to work harder to figure out what will work for you. Since you are already taking relevant classes, your professor(s) in the field can offer advice.

Ultimately, if you're much more interested in and committed to theory, it may make more sense to apply directly to PhD programs instead. Master's degrees are meant to be more practical. ",2020-03-08 02:59:04

I’m a masters student in religious ethics and I’m having so much trouble with paper topics. Basically, the feedback I got from every professor last semester is that my papers summarize the arguments from a scholar/philosopher/theologian well but I’m not actually writing anything interesting or new. I love grad school and I love learning. I love my field! But I’m feeling paralyzed when it comes to asserting my opinion or making original connections. I just don’t feel equipped with enough knowledge to do that yet. I know a lot of people say that but I’m scared I didn’t take enough foundational courses in undergrad. I really want to be a professor, but this is making me question my ability to be a true scholar. How do you come up with good questions in the humanities and move forward with confidence that you can write a ~20 page paper on it without summarizing someone else’s thoughts for >half of it?

>How do you come up with good questions in the humanities and move forward with confidence that you can write a \~20 page paper on it without summarizing someone else’s thoughts for >half of it?

&#x200B;

A good way to start here is to not just summarize. Take multiple authors and put them in dialogue with each other - what does author A say, and how does author B's point contradict that or strengthen the argument? Comparing and contrasting the work of different authors is a helpful way to figure out the shortcomings in the overall body of work as well, and can help identify a problem with the literature that you can try to solve with your work.

I also agree with the previous posts and don't think they necessarily contradict each other - go into the research and find what about it excites you, then explore the work done in that niche and work out the problems with the existing work.

The problem isn't not having foundational knowledge (I switched from a social science during undergrad to the humanities in postgrad - I had absolutely NO foundational knowledge but could still formulate research questions in the new field) but more about confidence. It takes some gut to say that another author, especially an established one, is doing something in a manner that could be done better, or that experts in the field are missing certain connections, or whatever -- but every single author is just a human being with limitations, and sometimes we get so stuck in our pattern of thinking that we forget some very obvious connections elsewhere. If you keep thinking about it as a shortage of knowledge, you just end up in a loop where you never feel like you know enough. There's always more to learn! The key is to learn as you go while doing research, not to learn first and do the research later :) ",2020-02-24 14:54:13

Over the past few years I've lost interest in teaching, pedagogy, etc, and become more interested in things like management, leadership, workplace culture, and so on, as they relate to education. I won't be the only teacher/former teacher to tell you that many admin/principals leave a lot to be desired and border on incompetent 

I'd been thinking about doing my PhD in educational leadership after I finished my MA, but after doing research into programs, I realized it's not quite what I'm looking for. A few days ago I was joking with my brother that I should just get a degree in business management, then started looking more seriously into the idea. I discovered Organizational Behavior, which is a lot closer to what I'm interested in. For example, a description from Washington University, one of the schools I'd be interested in:

*Olin’s Organizational Behavior program examines how individuals and groups affect and are affected by organizations and the people in them. As an Organizational Behavior PhD student, you’ll study organizations from multiple viewpoints, methods and levels of analysis—delving into management, leadership, negotiation, team development and conflict management, among other areas.*

This is exactly what I'd like to study, and I think it could be molded towards education as well. I know some people would think this is a random move or that you can't mix business with education, but frankly, I feel this would be a better bet for me rather than going the more traditional route

The other thing is that education is really insular - in my years as a teacher it felt like everyone was more or less mining from the same idea well, had similar attitudes/mindsets, etc. I can't speak about other fields, but public education is in desperate need of fresh ideas and perspectives, and I think having a blend of experience in the classroom as well as a background in business management could help me achieve that

In the last week of the course, we have a final assignment of providing the top 5 names of classmates that we believe contributed to our learning in the class.

For every classmate that puts your name down, you can receive 7pts. There is no cap on how many points you can receive, however, the syllabus allotted 40points (or 4%) of your total grade to this portion of the class. So, if you get all 40pts you get an A on this and any additional points you receive is just extra credit. Yes, I know that 7 doesnt go into 40 equally, no idea how they came up with this...

For me, I was only put down by one person, so I received 7 pts (lost 33pts) bringing my grade down from a 92% to an 88.7%.

My biggest question here is, in a grad school program or ANY program, how can 4% of my grade be subjectively judged by my peers to have this much of an impact overall in my course? I tried messaging my professor about this and they didnt view this as subjective so now I'm really stumped and just overall dont feel that this was appropriate.

166,emapp1,False,Academics,10,Should I take 4 math classes at the same time?,GradSchool,"TL;DR - I am a ""registered"" masters student in math, but I take undergrad math classes since my bachelors was in bio. In my bio bachelors, I took multivariable (including Stoke's theorem) and one class that combined intro to linear and intro to diffQ class. I took a gap year between undergrad and grad school, so I forgot most of math.

In my math masters, should I take real analysis, intro to proof, vector analysis (intro to linear algebra + stoke's theorem), and linear algebra (intro to some advance concepts) at the same time? 

Apologize for the long read in advance. I appreciate and welcome all constructive feedback. Thank you for your time.

========================================================================

My undergrad bachelors included classes A100 and A200. Not actual course numbers, but I modified for simplicity stake. **I took both A100 and A200 at the same time.** 

A100 - Multivariable Calculus that include Vectors, Partial derivatives, Lagrange multipliers,  Double and triple integrals, Spherical and cylindrical coordinates, Surface and line integrals. Divergence, gradient, and curl. Stokes Theorem and it's derivation to Green, Divergence, Fundamental Theorem, and General Stokes. 

For the midterms- I got a 

1. midterm 1 (vectors, PDE, lagrange) I got a 82,
2. midterm 2 (double, triple integrals, spherical, cylindrical, surface and line integrals) I got a 65 lol. Double and triple integrals are my weakness. This midterm was dropped.
3. midterm 3 (divergence, gradient, curl), I got a 85. 
4. On final (Divergence, gradient, curl, stokes theorem) I got an 88.

I forgot most of my calc 3 vector analysis knowledge. I got a B in the class though. 

A200 - A combined linear algebra and DiffQ class -  introduction to ODEs and linear algebra, Gaussian elimination, matrix theory, linear transformations, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, eigenvectors, eigenvalues and the diagonalization of matrices

1. Midterm 1 (ODEs - separable, non homogenous, homogenous, etc) I got a 91
2. Midterm 2 (Linear Algebra part - Gaussian elimination, RREF, matrix theory, linear transformations, vector spaces, subspaces, basis, eigenvalues). I got a 78 lol. I knew the concepts but damn the linear algebra symbols were tricky AF. This midterm was dropped.
3. Midterm 3 (Diagonalization of matrices, using linear algebra to solve ODEs, 2nd order) I got a 92.
4. Final (Combining everything with an emphasis on the midterm 3. Also more linear algebra symbols). I got a 87. 

I got an A- in A200. Class was curved and average was like a 85. I got an 88.5 in the class as a whole and got an A-.

&#x200B;

**This was my undergrad math classes. I took these 2 classes at the same time. My undergrad bachelors math was harder than my current undergrad classes (B100 - B5000) classes in terms of depth, homework, and problem solving.** 

===================================================================

Now the undergrad classes that I'm taking for my masters. 

B100 - Multivariable calculus  - Vectors, infinite series, Taylor's theorem,  partial derivatives, multiple integrals. I took this class and I got an A. 

***This multivariable class was so much easier than my bachelors A100 class. There was no vector analysis and stoke's theorem. Just basic vectors and infinite series and multiple integrals. I still suck at multiple integrals though.***

Now should I take 4 math classes at the same time?

1. B200 - Matrices,  determinants, general vector spaces, basis and dimension, eigenvalue problems, first order ODE linear equations, vector field theory, theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. **B200 looks like a combined A100 and A200 class. So my 2 undergrad math classes combined to one**.
2. B300 Intro to proofs -  Basic proofs in set theory, logic, mathematical induction, relations, orders, functions, Cantor's theory of countability, and real number system 
3. B400 Real Analysis  Sequences, properties of continuous functions, derivatives and differentials, functions defined by series, integrability and integrals, convergence of function sequences. 
4. B500 Linear Algebra -  Vector spaces, basis and dimension, matrices, linear transformations, determinants, solution of systems of linear equations, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, Jordan form, and image processing 

&#x200B;

Should I take all these 4 undergrad classes at the same time? 

Some things to consider:

1. My undergrad cumulative gpa was a 3.23. I went to an engineering school to study bio lol. The math was so much harder and more applied with some sprinkles of proof and theoretical. 
2. My quant GRE was bad too. I didn't study and got a 159 or 79%. I am still surprised I got into a math masters program lol. 
3. My advisor told me that I don't need intro to proof before taking real analysis. He wants me to take real analysis so I can be better prepared for grad level math which I'm going to take in the Fall of 2020. 
4. Time management wise.
   1.  intro to proof only meets Mondays and Wednesday. 
   2. Real Analysis meets Tuesdays and Thursday
   3. Linear Algebra meets Tuesday and Thursday after 2 hours after Real Analysis is done.
   4. Vector Analysis with some linear algebra meets Mondays and Wednesdays after 2 hours when intro to proof is done.

I don't have any other time commitments. It also takes me 1 hour to commute to school. I still have some struggles with multiple integrals and changes of basis. 

&#x200B;

Do you think it's worth it? Given the fact that I took some DiffQ, Linear, and Stokes theorem class (but I forgot it in my gap year), can I take 4 undergrad math classes at the same time? Should I drop intro to proofs?

167,eclrm9,False,Academics,13,(need advice) Supervisor moves out to another school,GradSchool,"So as the title said, early this week my supervisor told us that they'd most likely to move to another school in about 4 months. At the name they'd move, I'd have a semester left of my Master degree in the current school (school A) . I want to continue to Ph.D and had sent out registration for the program in school A (am an international student so paperwork admission is early)  and then I found out that the new school's (school B) admission had already closed. I can't really wait for a semester since the scholarship I have requires me to continue straight from Master or it will be cut. When my supervisor told me, they said I could finish my master as school A's student and then continue in school B. I don't mind doing that if my financial situation was better but because school B's area is much much more expensive and other expenses, the school B's dormitory is the only feasible place I could live in. I have asked my supervisor if they think I could get a room there, but their email replied was like ""Can you just email or phone them?"". It kinda broke my spirit to be fair since I know my chance would be small if I try to get it on my own (the dorm prioritize their own students after all) and they told me not to tell anyone about her moving because it's not official yet. I have looked up potential new supervisor but I feel like I couldn't contact them because it's not official yet. I feel rather helpless because I don't know what to do for my last semester...

I am in my second semester of graduate school (PhD program - electrical engineering). We are required to take the qualifying exam within 12 months of entering the program. I’m looking at roughly a late July of early August time frame to complete it.

We are required to form a committee of 3 professors from our field, none of whom can be our major advisor. My question is, as someone who is still pretty new to the area and university, how can I start forming relationships with professors prior to asking them to serve on a committee? 

One obvious alley that presents itself to me is to meet with them to talk about their research. But I’m not sure how to continue the relationship beyond that meeting as I have limited exposure to people on campus (I work/do research for my advisor most of the time at a lab off campus)?

I passed and got a job that I’ve been at since October. During this time, my committee/co-authors and I have been working on my manuscript via email. During my time as a grad student I never had any issues with my committee members or any of their edits except for one. One member refused to help most of the time, because he saw it as doing it for me. I get where he was coming from so I just taught myself instead of going to him with any questions. And before you ask, no I could not have replaced him on the committee unfortunately.

Now, out of the blue, he’s asked me for all of my data, and all of my Rstudio code under the pretense that he wanted it for another student who is working on a similar project. So I sent him most everything. However, I had a feeling he really just wanted to rerun all stats and analyses. Turns out my suspicions were correct when my advisor told me that my committee member had rerun everything without including me in this discussion. I am lead author on this manuscript, and I don’t appreciate that 1) he lied and 2) he didn’t even discuss with me that he wanted to rerun the analyses. He’s now emailing me for the original files and a key to match up the files to their designated number. Basically he’s not trusting me to have even done the most simple thing in matching up a key.

I’m unsure how to go about this. I don’t want to burn any bridges here, but at the same time I don’t appreciate that I’m being excluded from any and all discussions about this. This is my first lead author paper and I feel like I’m not learning how to go about being a lead author (isn’t that the whole point of being in school? To learn?!). This committee member also has a tendency to do everything for you in the classes he teaches (he’d always just write the r code for you in his informatics class) which is ironic since he refused to help me.

Additionally, my current supervisor (who knows all of my committee members/co-authors well) told me that I have my degree and that I owe this member nothing. I am unsure what to do in this situation.

I’m not far along at all. I should be most of the way through my research proposal and have my committee at least mostly established. Instead, I’m still trying to figure out what to do. I only have a vague idea of my project. I really get little to no support from my advisor, who is very busy and seems to expect me to be far more independent than any other advisors appear to expect from my peers. 

The worst of it is that despite this, I’d expect myself to be further along. I’m not farther along because I don’t care. My interests lie in marine and estuarine ecology, not freshwater, and turns out I’m not all that interested in doing research. Academia kind of just annoys me at this point?

I’ve already had some mental health issues the past year or two that are of course affecting this, but despite the fact that I’m doing better mentally and emotionally now with medication and healthy life habits, I’m as uninterested as ever. 

What I’m considering right now is switching from an MS to an MPS. There is an all coursework option, or a professional option where you do an internship and present a capstone on it at the end. The benefit of this would be 1. Doing something I’m more interested in obviously, and 2. Since it’s within the same school, most of my credits I’ve taken should apply easily. Otherwise I could apply to a different state school. Downside is many deadlines have passed so I would have to start in the spring, or narrow my options to those with later or rolling deadlines.

The major downside to this is losing my TA assistantship. I’m in state, and could take on some loans, but that doesn’t help my day to day situation. I’d have to find some sort of part time job to pay for rent, my car, etc. Or take out some extra loans to help fund that.

I'm  graduating in May with a degree in Human Resources Management. While  I've enjoyed this field, I've found myself more drawn to I/O psychology  and social psychology, wishing I majored in this field instead. When I  graduate, I will have 9 - 12 hours of undergraduate psychology  experience under my belt (research lab, general psych, and social  psych). I didn't enjoy school til this last semester, and as a result  (and losing my father), I have a 3.15 GPA.

I  spoke with a professor today who took the time out of his day to tell  me his career path, how he went from business, to I/O psych, and finally  to social psychology. I believe that if I were to pursue an extended  education in psychology, I would certainly need a PhD to make $100k or  more.

I'm trying to figure out how I should go about getting a PhD - some options are below:

A)  Work full time & have my employer pay for grad school - perhaps  online? I'm worried about being overwhelmed and sacrificing the quality  of my education if I go this route.

B)  Go to grad school ASAP, and take on student debt. Potentially work  part-time at the university, and receive tuition assistance of some sort  due to being an employee of the university.

C) Pursue a PhD program (though I doubt I could get into one due to not majoring in Psych as an undergrad, and my GPA).

My  biggest concern with doing a PhD is the amount of my time spent doing  this. I don't want to take a long break from school only to go back, and  I don't want to spend more than 8 years on a PhD. Ideally, I'd get my  PhD over with in the quickest time possible, so working while pursuing  it may not be ideal either. My school (University of Tennessee) does NOT  have an I/O master's program, but I would be interested in going to  MTSU for a master's in I/O...

192,egchz8,False,Academics,7,Information about Masters in CS/Visual Computing at Saarland University - I asked some questions I had in mind to a few students and thought I'd share their responses for other prospective students.,GradSchool,"I had got an admit for Visual Computing at Saarland, and I'd asked around about the university to a few current/past students. Just thought I'd share their answers for everyone who might be thinking of pursuing a Masters here. Note that some of the information is specific to CS/Visual Computing, and may not hold for other programs. I've numbered the answers, where each number corresponds to a specific student's answer. I've copied their answers verbatim, except fixing typos and removing personal details.

**Q1: As a Saarland student, do you have a chance of getting to work with  researchers from MPI and DFKI, while being a Masters student? For  instance, do a lot of students get to do their Masters theses at  MPI/DFKI/any other research cluster? What does this depend on, your  grades/the program you're attending/networking with profs?**

**A1**: Yes. As a master's student, I am involved with MPI-INF as a research  assistant (HiWi). Yes, there are plenty of masters students who do their  thesis with these institutes.

**A2**: Yes, you can get work there. I know countless people who started working at DFKI close to the start of their studies, even when they weren't good at coding yet. I also know people who worked at the Scheer Tower, CISPA, or others. It should be absolutely no problem to  find a small side job during your studies. For theses: usually, professors will openly suggest topics and you  talk about it to them OR you have a topic in mind, talk to a professor  about it and he will either connect you with people who know a lot about  the topic or do the supervision himself. It is mandatory that your  first supervisor is a professor (being a professor is something more  unique in Germany than in in the US, it doesn't just mean ""lecturer""). I  know people who did their theses at DFKI combined with their side job, I  know some who did it just with a professor and I personally did mine at  a company, working together with one professor. Lots of possibilities.

**A3**: Yes, for instance I am doing my master's thesis in MPI and I know of a lot of students who do it in either DFKI/MPI.

**A4**: Yes, grades matter but so does prior experience. It can help if you've taken a course with the prof. in question but isn't strictly necessary. If you're going to reach out to someone it's also important to write a nice motivation letter describing your research interests and to make connections to what research is being done in the department, i.e. send a targeted application and not a generic one.

**A5**: Yes - grades are important - how you performed in their classes - you can go talk to them.

&#x200B;

**Q2: What do most Saarland graduates end up doing? Do they go on to do a PhD  at one of the associated research institutes, or move to industry? I did try to learn this from LinkedIn but it seems skewed towards research.**

**A1**: Research. Masters students, for some reason, do not seem to be very  motivated to pursue positions in the industry. I am not one of them, and  I hope to go back to the industry as soon as I am done.

&#x200B;

**Q3: What's the student:prof ratio like, in Visual Computing (VC)? I mean, are profs usually responsive to individual queries/project discussions?**

**A1**: Not sure about ratios. Some lectures have a lot of students, some hardly  have 20 students attending them. Really depends on whether it's a core  course, whether the subject is easy e.t.c. Professors have office hours  during which you can approach them. As far as I have noticed, they encourage discussions.

**A2**: I don't know the exact ratio but it heavily depends on the courses.  There are courses with hundreds of people but also some with only 20-50.  It would be interesting to know where you're from. University here is  QUITE different to the UK/US. Brits and Americans have told me that in  their home countries, it's more like school, there are more resources  (because of the higher costs) which means you can go to the professor  any time you want and they will always be able to help you on the spot. In Germany, university expects you to be more independent, meaning  that you're expected to work through things yourself. Obviously you can  email your professor anytime and go to office hours and whatnot but I've  often heard complains from (especially) Americans that they felt like  they don't get enough support. The job of a professor in Germany is  research + teaching as opposed to only teaching, so they often have a  LOT on their schedule and are therefore more busy. But obviously, you  will find professors who are very communicative and some who are not. It  all depends.

**A3**: I don't know the exact number, you can check the visual computing page for the number of profs. Some professors are very helpful/responsive some aren't. Usually the ""in demand"" professors are less responsive especially if you send them unsolicited (also not very well drafted) emails asking for thesis/hiwi, etc. You can check online for general rules of emailing profs, there are some good posts on Quora/StackOverflow.

**A4**: As a general caveat, I completed the masters a few years ago and things have changed a little since then, mostly that more students are applying/getting accepted and the course selection/profs have changed a little. It depends on the course, but usually the ratio is OK and in any case all profs/tutors usually have a one-hour weekly slot for office hours and it shouldn't be tough to get an appointment to discuss whatever you need to.

**A5**: Depends - if you have a good profile - yes.

&#x200B;

**Q4: Do you happen to know anything about the courses and the quality of teaching in the VC program?**

**A1**: VC program has a lot of overlap with the computer science program, though VC is more restrictive in the sense that you *have*  to take some mandatory lectures. Quality of ""teaching"" depends really  on the professors. The courses, including the assignments, are usually  designed well, and the assignments will contain material not covered in  the lecture. This is not necessarily a bad thing.

**A2**: I do not. I would think that at least some of them would overlap with normal CS courses. For those I can say that some people say that CS courses at Saarland University are a little more theoretical than at  other universities. But CS here has an excellent reputation and I've never known a graduate who did not get a good job afterwards.

**A3**: Again, just like at any university the quality varies but there are some profs who are exceptionally good at teaching e.g. Prof. Weickert.

**A4**: The quality of the program and the courses are very good.

**A5**: I was in VC program - I changed to CS - it has a rigid structure and is quite math heavy.

&#x200B;

**Q5: It's stated on the VC program site that students can take core CS  courses and go on to get a Masters in CS. Do you happen to know people in CS who've done this successfully? I was wondering what the experience is like.**

**A1**: I know students who switched from VC to a CS degree, because they found  the bucketing system in VC (i.e, you have to complete x credits in topic  y) annoying. Computer Science do not have any mandatory courses, and  hence you are never forced to study a topic you do not like.

**A2**: I do not. It's not that uncommon to take courses from other specializations though. A friend of mine did a bachelors for both  ""Medieninformatik"" and normal ""Informatik"" (CS).

**A3**: I know some people who have switched halfway through, it isn't complicated. Some people do it because the course requirements are less rigid for CS and you need slightly less coursework because some credit points go towards your MSc thesis presentation. If you're asking about getting a double degree, you might have to take some additional courses and do a second thesis.

**A4**: As a VC student you can transfer to CS if your grades are good, the courses you can take as a CS student and a VC student are more or less the same.

&#x200B;

**Q6: In general, what's the work/life balance like? I understand different  people have different paces and lifestyles, but assuming that a student  doesn't slack off and doesn't party much, is the pace of teaching  manageable? For instance, do you see people in CS/VC struggling to keep up?**

**A1**: Depends on the quality of the student, and more importantly, the choice  of lectures. You would have an easy time coping up with HCI  (Human-Computer Interaction - it is a core course) if you decide to take  that course. But instead, if you are taking a mathy core course like  optimization, naturally you will find if a bit more challenging.  Personally, I think that the coursework is very manageable. If you are  having a hard time, there's no penalty associated with dropping out of a  course. And students tend to do this a lot - they usually sign up for a  lot of courses, realise later that a) they don't like it or b) they  like it but do not have time for it, and this is very normal behavior.  For instance, I attended machine learning lectures this semester (core, 9  credits), realised that I have too much on my plate and there's no way  I'll find time for all the things that I am doing. Also, the ML course  this semester was offered by the math department, and I am not a fan of  their notations and love for theorems. So I stopped attending ML  lectures, and signed up for an ""elements of statistical learning""  course. The topics are *very* similar to the ML course, but it is  just 5 credits (hence less work load) and they don't care much about  proofs. The point I am trying to make is, Saarland is very flexible. I'm  sure you will be able to find some combination of coursework that you  would be able to cope up with.

**A2**: Obviously extremely different from person to person. There are courses  that are known to be difficult and others that are known to be easier. I  think most people struggle with math the most, although this might be  more for the bachelor's than the master's degree. I think it should be  fine if you apply yourself a little bit. Semester breaks are long in  Germany (2-3 months twice a year, if you don't take seminars during that  time), so you always have some time to relax and cool down.

**A3**: Yes, it's manageable. Finding people to do assignments with helps. Often you are encouraged to hand them in in groups.

**A4**: Depends on the courses you take, but yes, people do struggle if they  take more difficult courses, it depends on your priorities, what type of  courses you want to take, how fast you want to finish, etc.

**A5**: I didn't have a work-life balance - especially during my thesis - it's all work - for me it was...but it's manageable.

&#x200B;

**Q7: For administrative tasks and filling paperwork, do you need to know fluent German?**

**A1**: Yes. You must know German. But I don't speak any German. I managed anyway. So will you ;)

**A2**: I'm gonna say no because of all my American friends surviving despite  not being close to fluent in the language. You should prepare yourself  for LOTS of annoying bureaucracy at the start though. In the first few  weeks, there's gonna be a LOT of annoying paperwork that has to be done.  But people are usually helpful enough and if you struggle too much,  Germans you will meet will help you out with translating.

**A3**: No. Although I was already fluent in German, so I can't speak to this much. Isn't a barrier as far as I can tell from friends.

**A4**: You can get by without knowing German, you can use Google translate and all but in some cases it may be difficult.

**A5**: No no, you will get help - so don't worry.

&#x200B;

**Q8: I read that Saarland dormitories have a long waiting list. Do you happen to know how far back you need to book a slot, to have a good chance of  getting it?**

**A1**: The waiting period is a semester. I ended up getting a one-room apartment (studio?) in the city.

**A2**: Yes, they are always at full capacity and especially during winter  times, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to find a spot if you don't apply  extremely early. The majority people live in so-called WGs  (Wohngemeinschaften) which just means shared flat with other people  (usually other students). This is the most cost-efficient option if you  don't generally dislike people (and also you will make friends much  easier).

**A3**: No idea, but it's tricky to get a place and it's best to start as early as possible.

**A5**: That's tough - don't rely on it.

&#x200B;

**Q9: Do you have any specific website recommendations for student apartments (shared housing) in Saarbrucken?**

**A1**: There are a lot of WGs (i.e shared apartments). I sort of wanted to live alone, and hence got my room [here](https://www.studentenwohnungen-saarbruecken.de/unsere-wohnangebote-fur-studenten-saarbruecken.html).

**A2**: The most common one by FAR is [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/). The optimal places for students are St.Johann, Mitte or  Alt-Saarbrücken. St.Johann covers much of the city center and also  includes the ""Nauwieserviertel"" which is basically the student's quarter  full of pubs. Mitte is also in the city center but usually more  expensive and Alt-Saarbrücken is a little quieter, further away but  really cheap to live in. Dudweiler is also extremely close to the  university but it's VERY far away from the inner city and anything..  exciting. But they have a nice climbing gym at least.

**A3**: This group: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/862796117115095/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/862796117115095/) and this website: [https://www.wg-gesucht.de/](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/).

&#x200B;

**Q10: Are there ample computing resources available to students at Saarland?  For instance, for deep learning experiments or rendering, one would need  access to GPU servers with high RAMs, often for a prolonged duration  (long-running experiments/simultaneous experiments). Are such resources  readily available to students?**

**A1**: Yes. I took a high-level computer vision course (offered by MPI) on my first semester and the course involved a project, and all students were given access to decent GPUs. I don't remember exactly, but I think they were P100s. Basically, you SSH into MPI/University resources through a VPN.

**A2**: We had this at the Computational Linguistics department to train language models etc. and our department is soooo much smaller. So I would definitely think: yes. But that's a question you could ask the Studienkoordinator.

**A3**: Not sure about this. The deep learning boom took off when was already a research assistant in the computer vision department.

**A5**: I would assume..

&#x200B;

**Q11: I've heard that the style of teaching math is rather ""dry"" in German  universities, with less emphasis on proof motivation and visualization,  and more on terse theorem-proof sessions. Would you say that is true to a  large extent, or is this dependent on individual profs?**

**A1**: That statement is true, but fortunately not so much in Saarland. But  then again, I avoid proof-heavy math courses like the plague, so I might  not be the best person to answer this. The assignments do sometimes ask  the students to prove something, and I sometimes do get get annoyed  with this.

**A2**: Yes, that's what I hear a lot too. Math can get rather dry. My math  courses were nothing like CS courses, so I cant compare them with mine.

**A3**: Depends on the professor, and I don't know what your reference point is here, but some do place a lot of emphasis on theorem proofs, and some don't.

**A5**: That's true - I think.

&#x200B;

**Q12: Is there any academic advantage/disadvantage in enrolling in one semester over another, for VC?**

**A1**: Nope.

**A2**: In my experience, the winter semester is the 'normal' one to start for  MOST pograms. That's when you have most of the introductory courses,  etc. But i can absolutely not say if this is the case for VC I'm afraid.

**A3**: Depends on the courses on offer, but one nice course for the first semester which I believe is offered in the summer is the Image Processing and Computer Vision course. Ultimately, I don't think it matters too much.

**A5**: Not really - not imo

&#x200B;

**Q13: How does the process of getting MPI to approve you doing your Masters  thesis there work? Is it like, you get good grades in a set of courses  related to the work of a researcher in MPI, contact him over email  asking for a RA position, then have an interview with them? Or do you  discuss your interests with one of the profs at Saarland, they recommend  your name over to a researcher at MPI, who then contacts you for an  interview?**

**A1**: In my case, I just went to the lecturer at the end of the course (i.e  the last lecture of the course) and straight up asked him ""Is there a  way I can contribute to your research, preferably as a HiWi?"". He said  yes. By this point, he was familiar with me (I was a regular in the  class), and my assignment grades were good. He asked me to email him,  and mention that we talked after the lecture, and that was it. He read  through my resume and offered me a HiWi. Usually, if the  professor/lecturer does not know you, you go through an interview - I  didn't have to since he knew me. Getting a masters thesis at MPI follows  a similar pattern - turn up for lectures offered by people from the  MPI, get okayish grades at least, and then walk up to the professor and  ask. If you seem motivated enough, the professor will usually be happy  to have you as a thesis student. *Some* departments, like D2 at  MPI-INF (Multimodal computing and machine learning) are quite in demand  (everyone and their grandmother wants to do a thesis in ML+CV) and thus  has a GPA cutoff - 1.5 or better. That's an unfairly high cutoff, since  unlike the US, Germany does not have grade inflation, and you have to be  really good at giving exams to maintain an overall GPA of 1.5 or  higher. However, regardless of your GPA, most departments will offer you a thesis if you do reasonably well in their particular course and show sufficient motivation.

&#x200B;

**Q14: How easy is it to make the switch from VC to CS (Do you need to maintain high grades?  Does it depend on CS student strength at the time?), and when can it be  done at the earliest?**

**A1**: It's quite easy. You just have to fill out an application form. Yes, you  must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher, and you can switch only after the  first semester. Getting 2.0 or higher shouldn't too difficult.

&#x200B;

**Q15: If I decide to take courses at a slow pace, can I stay and study beyond the normal duration of the program?**

**A1**: Yup. You have a whopping 6 semesters to complete your coursework (i.e 90  credits). And then you can take another semester to do your thesis, I  guess. There's some restriction - for example, you *must*  complete 9 credits by the end of your first semester, 30 by the end of  the second, and so on (I forgot the exact numbers). But yes, you can  take more than the normal duration of the program. Also, there's no  ""normal"" duration of the program. Most students I know take 5 semesters -  4 semesters for coursework + a semester for the thesis. But I took more  courses than recommended, and I'm set to complete my coursework by my  3rd semester. I'll probably do the thesis on my fourth semester and be  done with the whole thing, or skip my fourth semester altogether to do  an internship somewhere, though I don't have any internship offers as of  yet. But then again, I was fine with filling up all my free time with assignments and the HiWi job, and not working so hard for the exams. Long story short, how fast you  want to graduate depends all on you. If you go all in, and enroll for  courses during the semester breaks as well (yes, some courses are  offered during the break), then you *can* be done with your  coursework in almost two semesters, and move on to your thesis. That  puts the earliest graduation date as 3 semesters.

&#x200B;

**Q16: What is it like to do a HiWi job at MPI? I mean, what does your day to  day work look like? Do you actually get involved with the prof's  research and get to publish stuff?**

**A1**: This varies *wildly*. I think I won the HiWi lottery though. I  somewhat contribute to the research (i.e helped build a research  toolkit). I am not micro-managed, and my working hours are very flexible, and I'm on friendly terms with my advisor (we get a beer  together once every few weeks). But as far as I understand, what I have  is an exception and not the norm. An overwhelming majority of HiWi jobs are web dev stuff that  do not usually lead to a publication. However, if you do a good job,  you dramatically increase the chances of getting a thesis there, or in  any case, your advisor might be able to give you a recommendation letter  based on your HiWi.

&#x200B;

**Q17: Of the courses you've taken so far, what courses did you love? Also, are  there any courses that you'd blindly suggest to avoid (prof irregular,  teaching unclear with fast pace)? Of course, interests vary across  people, but I'm just trying to get a general idea of the department's strengths and weaknesses when it comes to teaching.**

**A1**: I'll give you a short summary of the courses I took last summer semester:

a. IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) - well structured, you  get a very good understanding of image analysis (sobel and gaussian  filters, fourier transforms, optical flow etc), and the lectures are interesting.

b. (HLCV) High Level Computer Vision - Offered by MPI. Lectures are *bad*  \- they're not boring but there are 200 slides per lecture and yet the  professor (Bernt Schiele) finishes early. I remember explicitly asking  him ""do I need a deep learning background for this course?"" and he  smiled and said, ""not necessarily, you should be able to pick things up  during the course"". I did pick things up, but only because my team put  in an insane amount of time on the assignments. HLCV basically drops you  at the deep end of the pool, and you either sink or you swim. But the  assignments and the project was worth it - I am quite confident with  pytorch now and the background I got really helped me with the other  courses. Once you go through HLCV, you can go through anything. Dr.  Schiele also explicitly mentioned that ""If you survive the first 2  assignments, you will survive the course"". I would heavily recommend  this course, but be prepared to slog.

c. AI (Artificial Intelligence). Waste of time. I took this only  because it was just algorithms, and it was a core course (9 credits).  This was supposed to be my ""easy course"", and though the assignments  were easy enough, the exam was a Kobayashi Maru. You are given 2 hours,  and until you write (and think) really fast, you can't complete the  exam. Given enough time, I could have scored a lot more. Makes me wonder  what they are trying to evaluate - my understanding of the subject or  how fast I can churn out algorithms? I ended up getting a 2.7 for this  easy subject, but I won't complain since I got my 9 credits without  working much for it.

d. TNIR (Topics in Neural Information Retrieval). My favorite course  last summer semester. The assignments involved reading actual research  papers and writing an essay comparing and contrasting them. Had a lot of  fun, and since you read a lot of research papers, you get a good idea  of the research field *and* a sense of accomplishment towards the  end of the course. But this can  be quite dry if you are not into NLP/IR.

e. German classes. Enough said.

&#x200B;

**Q18: If you do an internship at a company in the last semester, whom would  you work with for your thesis? A prof from Saarland or a company person?**

**A1**: For doing your thesis with a company, you have to get a professor from  the university to co-supervise you. Not sure if professors like doing  this. In any case, you can do an internship without it being a thesis -  you get 6 credit points for doing a ""praktikum"" - i.e an industrial  internship. The main reason students would like an industry thesis is  that they get paid there, while no professor would pay a Masters thesis student at the University.

&#x200B;

**Q19: I hear Saarland has a gym (Uni-fit). Do you happen to know how much they charge students?**

**A1**: Oh yeah, I use the uni-gym. It's around 20 euros a month for the students.

&#x200B;

**Q20: Is there anything else you wish an international student knew before joining Saarland?**

**A2**: Travel! Saarland is basically in the heart of Europe, you can get to  so many places. Paris is only 2-3 hours away. There are lots of German  cities to visit, too. There is so much to see and you should take  advantage of living so centrally in Europe. All my international friends  said that they loved how easy it was to travel through all of Europe. About studying here generally: never stress too much about  university, there is so much other stuff in life. Take time for your  hobbies, relax and to make and meet friends.  I consider some  international friends I met as some of my best friends to this day.  Don't see studying abroad just a cheap option to study but also to  broaden your horizons.

In 25 years of time, the entirety of the US university system has produced two results in plant biotech.  That's it, two results in a quarter century, and one won't even be on the market for a few years.  I tried to work with so many people to do something about that, I could have done more, but there was a grand total of zero interested in doing their damned job.  They're either incompetent, or paid off corporate shills, and po-tay-to po-tah-to at this point.  And God forbid you talk about anything that isn't a corn/soy monoculture.

Science is about making the world a better place for humanity, and in case you haven't noticed there's an impending climate crisis that's going to demand an increased focus on sustainability, but all they're interested in is sitting on their hands and taking about how much they love their corporate handlers.  What a waste of two degrees and too many years, I should have gone into medical biotech from the start, at least that has a future.  No wonder there's an anti-GMO movement, they might be science denialists but they're fully justified in their suspicions, and I am very close to going to Twitter and letting them know exactly how I feel, and since those quacks are always looking for vindication from people with degrees that would be very bridge burn-y but it isn't like I have anything else going for me.

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director of aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would be a precursor to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead \[to\] is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals & going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'
* etc other things somewhere... duno where i put them..  cant think of anything else off top of mind atm

historical note for myself: 'were you asking a clarifying question in order to gain understanding?'",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gzddli/longterm_relationships_within_and_after_grad/,0,"Two processes I would say trump creative problem-solving are learning to love actively and perseverance.

Learning to love actively keeps both people in a relationship able to constantly support one another, which improves quality of life both for each individual as well as the couple as a whole. Active love could be creative but is often made up of mundane things that matter little to oneself but a lot to one's partner.

Perseverance despite difficulty allows the relationship to be longterm. Without it, there is no hope of a future. And, the longer it is practiced, the more equinamity and perspective a person develops because they begin to see the large bumps in the metaphorical road as small bumps over a long course. The more difficulties a couple passes through together, the more confident they become that they will be able to surmount other challenges in the future.

Creative problem-solving is useful but I don't see it as the most important quality to come out of a relationship. Rather I would say it is more a sense of agape, of old, familiar, altruistic, and well-humored love. ",2020-06-09 01:48:02

My previous employment (unrelated to the psychology field) has been terminated due to COVID, so I wanted to take advantage of this time to apply for new jobs that would help me in my program and prepare me for my career.

What kinds of jobs are you holding down in grad school? Are they related to your field? Has anyone worked as a personal assistant to someone whose work they admired? If so, how did it go? What is a realistic expectation for working while in grad school?

P.S. I am interested in studying Eco-Psychology, Community Psychology, holistic therapies (hypnotherapy, energy work, and alternative medicine) if that helps.

Thanks in advance!

You should be paid as a teaching assistant or research assistance (or through fellowship). Sometimes people take side jobs like bartending or summer internships to make some extra money. Sometimes people will finish off their thesis part time while working full elsewhere. I’m sure depending on the program a part time PhD is possible but it would take a very long time considering a typical full time PhD in the US is 5 years. ,2020-05-05 18:01:04

What I want to know is how to do it graciously so I do not burn a bridge professionally with my advisor, given all that he has invested in me as a student. Others who have quit- what advice do you have on what to do/not to do? 

Context: I did my MS with the same advisor, and am currently about a year into my PhD program in engineering (starting off taking classes only part time). We have a good relationship and I think he is a fair, level-headed professor and I respect him. I failed my first try at 2/3 qualifying exams and am scheduled to re-try in late June. We submitted a couple proposals for research funding this year, but they have not been approved yet and I think I could pull mine out of consideration without too much trouble. My advisor and I have put a lot of time into creating these proposals, which is why I fear I might burn a bridge by quitting. Also, given that the university is closed, I would have to tell him over video chat, which might be unprofessional. 

Reason for quitting: I have many, from change of career goals to realizing I do not like or want to be involved in academia, ever. Mainly my career goals changed after being in industry for a year and I realized to get the type of job I see myself growing into I don’t need a PhD.

221,gljikk,False,Professional,4,What are my options when I graduate?,GradSchool,"Hi everyone! I am in a masters program right now in electrical engineering studying neural engineering. I am trying to decide whether I should stick with this or BME when I graduate, switch to something with clinical options like clinical psych or an MD/PhD, or switch to a completely different field. Like many of you, I would love a job as faculty, even in a community college just to teach, but the chances of that are slim. I’ve had multiple internships in electrical engineering positions in industry and hated all of them. While it’s possible it was because the work was boring for someone with just a bachelor’s degree, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to work in industry. That being said, if I get my PhD in neural engineering, are my options really academia (unlikely) or industry? Are there any other options for someone with a PhD in this field? Are there any other related fields I could switch to that would give me more options, especially either in teaching or some type of human interaction (hence the clinical work idea)? 

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, but there isn’t really a neural engineering sub so I wasn’t sure where to ask this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gljikk/what_are_my_options_when_i_graduate/,0,"I'm a recently graduate EE PhD with focus in neural engineering and now have a TT faculty position. Do **not** go into BME unless you want to become a medical device salesman. Find an EE lab with an emphasis on applications rather than theory. Try and get into a top 10 school. Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, Penn all have outstanding relevant programs. If you're not that competitive, aim for a school that's made a mark on the field. University of Utah, for example, developed the Utah Electrode Array, the only penetrating microelectrode array approved for human clinical trials, is the origin of the original neural amplifier, and is home to 2  prominent neural companies (Blackrock and Ripple). UT Dallas is also in a good situation for a lower ranked University with Abbott neuromodulation being local.

If you get the above, your dreams of academia are possible. The competition for TT faculty is lower for EE than probably any other field. This is because EE PhDs make so much money in industry, why would you accept *half* as much to teach? It's insane (I am TT EE faculty, btw). In fact, many EE faculty don't even do postdocs, which are required for virtually every other academic field.

The next step is to tailor your PhD to the job you want. Teaching oriented colleges want to see industry experience, so get internships in the summer. They also require that you have teaching experience and would prefer if you had experience training undergrads in research and projects, so try and become a senior project advisor during your PhD or mentor undergrads in your research lab. See if your institution has any ""teaching higher Ed"" courses or similar. Mine had an emphasis for phds seeking TT jobs.

Make sure you talk to faculty at other institutions. Connections will be king. I applied to over 20 positions, got interviews from all 3 where I or my advisor new someone, and only 2 of 20 where I didn't. Applying to faculty positions is hard. It took me more than 8 hours per application. Wasting time on applying to places you don't know people, and thus have a low chance, is painful (but necessary). 

If  you don't land an academic job, there are government jobs. Federal jobs are incredibly annoying to apply to, but there are some really cool positions. It is best if you can find a mentor to help you figure out how to apply to the fed jobs, because they are weirdly particular. 

There are also the national labs. National labs fall somewhere between industry and academia. Berkeley national lab is particularly interesting and it specifically has no classified research and had a neuroscience division. Engineers there will usually work as solution innovators for various other departments. I spent 2 years at one and worked with neuroscientists, physicists, biochemists, and others.

I hate how biased research is, how results are so fickle and most data out there isn't even reproducible, and how slow and unfulfilling it feels. I don't hate my research topic personally, but I'm definitely just doing it because it's my job at this point. I'm pretty much just trying to finish my program to get the Ph.D. and start my career.

Personally, I'm extremely interested in teaching, and education has always been a huge interest of mine. I want to be a professor so badly, but I don't want to run a lab or have to do research on the side. I love working with students and have a lot of experience in that.

Lots of people with PhDs do this - it is, like, 100% of the Rollins' staff.

225,gax551,False,Professional,5,How do I report the duration of my research assistant job on my resume? (weird situation),GradSchool,"Given my circumstances, I'm not sure how long I can technically say I was working as a research assistant while a PhD student or even if I was a ""research assistant"" and not something else. Forgive any extraneous details that follow. It's just easier to lay it all out.

So, basically, there were two channels of funding, but for the same project. My department was funding me on a research assistantship which I used to conduct field work abroad--this wasn't just dissertation work, it also could be characterized as consultancy work, which is why it's on my resume. That assistantship had a clear start date and cut-off date, with regular paychecks. However, my adviser also got funding for the same project and had written me into that grant, but that funding came later and as a lump-sum. So during the middle of my field work I was able to get a one-time payment of $10,000. I considered part of that to be reimbursement for research-related out-of-pocket expenses (though there was no paperwork involved) and part of it was just general compensation for the work I did and was still to do. I have no idea what my ""rate"" was in the grant proposal so I have no idea how long that $10,000 was supposed to last me, but it wasn't until a year and a half later, and a whole year after my assistantship ended, that I finally was able to wrap up my end of the project and produce a deliverable. I had not been working as dilligently on it as I could have been. But even so, my adviser was so happy with my work that at the very end he decided to pay me an extra $4,000 still remaining out of the project funds. 

So what I'm confused about is how I'm supposed to report the length of time that I worked on this project when I really worked on it off and on and had really irregular payments. The length of time I was on a research assitantship (12 months) doesn't seem to fit, because I also got separate funding for the same job. The length of time from start to finish (29 months) doesn't seem to fit, because I worked on it off and on during that time. Should I perhaps figure out a daily rate for myself, then work backwards from the $14,000 I received from my adviser to estimate duration from that, then add it consecutively to the research assistantship? But what about resumes that don't require me to report salary? Is the 29-month logic legit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gax551/how_do_i_report_the_duration_of_my_research/,2,Payment and funding source don’t matter.

228,fejt9d,False,Professional,6,When does it make sense to start over post-PhD?,GradSchool,"Venting time. In my late 30s, graduated with a masters 9 years ago and a PhD just over a year ago--both related to park-management in a developing country context--have done absolutely nothing since. Have no professional experience or skills that are sought after in the general job market and jobs in my area of expertise are extremely rare (have sent 6 jobs applications in the past year). Only have one publication to date and no history of independently obtaining research funds so post-doc opportunities aren't happening either. 

Right around the time I graduated I thought my prospects were looking up. A government agency in one of the countries I did my research in wanted to hire me to do a project and had me outline a contract for it. Also, my adviser and I also worked on a proposal for a separate project that would give me a job for the next 2 years and serve as a platform for a lot more research. 

Long story short, the government agency gets back to me months later, not with a completed contract, but to inform me that they since realized they can't hire me directly and have to put the project out for tender (which I can't bid on myself since I'm a foreigner). So the contract I wrote, which is based entirely on my dissertation, ends up going to a consulting firm that's only interested the occasional skype call with me as a courtesy. Then I just find out today that the major proposal my adviser and I worked on was rejected because my adviser didn't fill out a certain form completely.  

I have spent the better part of the last year thinking at least one of these opportunities would materialize. I am now in the most desperate position I have ever been in my life and I'm not young anymore. I can't imagine being in a more humiliating position than I'm already in, so what I'm wondering is whether I need to start over and pursue another masters degree? Perhaps in something more marketable? I had no idea what a dead end a PhD would be if you weren't successful enough at it. For all my adult life I thought I was working towards a certain career path but since graduating it feels like my life is over. 

I guess just so this post isn't a pure rant, would I at least have some post-doc prospects if I could get 1 or 2 more publications out?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/fejt9d/when_does_it_make_sense_to_start_over_postphd/,13,Seriously a) 6 job applications is nothing you should be doing like 30 a week b) a postdoc may or may not help you if you want an industrial job because only about half of employers count that experience and many don't care about the number of papers you have. Look I know looking for a job is soul crushing and getting rejected from a position you know you are qualified for and you are very interested in sucks but 100% this is a numbers game when it comes to applications. I will also say as far as a postdoc is concerned if you have a chance to do one to learn some new you could argue it was worth it but if you are looking to just publish more it is a gamble. The thing is you could be the Stephen Hawking of your field and if you get assigned a shit project publish literally nothing in which case you probably were better off not doing it. ,2020-03-06 20:39:57

I'm debating whether it is worth it to go back for my senior year if my school is online, or if I should take the year off, work, and go back once I can actually show up to labs. This would, of course, be dependent on me actually finding a lab job of some type- if I'm going to take a year off, I should at least gain some relevant skills.

My goal is to become a professor at a PUI, but that's feeling less and less realistic every day and I'm starting to feel like I'll never have a career that I am passionate about and where I feel valued in my workplace.

241,fw1qnf,False,Professional,1,Industry internship might conflict with advisor's company,GradSchool,"I have a weirdly specific question that I'm hoping to get some advice or insight into. I'm working with my advisor at the moment on developing therapeutics in a pretty small field. My advisor started a company last year that is still very new, and when I joined the lab he told me in no uncertain terms that I could contribute to its growth if I wanted to (that was part of the reason I joined in the first place).

Ultimately, I am interested in joining industry after graduation and my PhD program offers a pretty cool industry internship program that I can participate in during any part of my thesis work (with sufficient permission from my advisor). When I joined his lab, I told him that I would really want to participate in this program towards the end of my PhD and he was very supportive of this.

So here is my dilemma. Should I do an internship with a company that has direct conflicts with my advisor's company (especially if it has a lot of big shots in the field, a great working environment, and several opportunities to engage in the topics I am interested in)? Or should I find an internship in another field that might still develop the same skills/provide a similar network? I'm not super tied to this field so I'd be willing to change if necessary but I also feel like my skill set and experience would be best utilized in the field I am already in.

247,f4lgkx,False,Professional,8,"Don't know if my academic career path is common, but I think this is how academia should be.",GradSchool,"Hi there,

I've noticed lately that when I speak to my peers in other labs/universities they think my career path is highly unusual, and are also highly surprised at what I've accomplished so far.

&#x200B;

In 1st year of undergrad: I met two quantum physics professors. 

I wrote to the first asking to do research and was accepted to the lab despite just graduating from high school. This prof privately tutored me in quantum mechanics so I could do the research, and I learned a lot of practical scientific knowledge from this(totally different from classroom science).

The second quantum physics professor told me about how academia works. After that I always knew what admin and professors wanted/expected from me and how to manipulate the system to my advantage.

&#x200B;

In 3rd year of undergrad: I met a mechanical engineering professor in a class.

I impressed him in a lecture and after I graduated he offered me a paid research position in his lab. The salary was decent (30% more than the best PhD stipends), so I took the job to ""try out"" academia before committing to it. I saw this prof 5 hours every week where he'd quiz me on what I was doing, suggest improvements, and most importantly teach me about how to write good journal papers and get them accepted (responding to reviewers too).  I did full-time paid research for 2.5 years, and published 2 first author papers and 2 second author papers in journals during that time. These papers I wrote on my PhD gradschool applications.

My boss moved to Vanderbilt University in the US, and offered me a PhD position with a normal stipend (not as much as I made before), but let me focus on filing patents and running a company should I choose to do my PhD with him. I did also get interviewed at a top school for a PhD position(Electrical Engineering), and am waiting for their reply.

&#x200B;

Anyway, most people think it is highly unusual that I had 3 professors in undergrad mentoring my scientific career. I don't understand how the next generation of researchers are supposed to be trained without good mentoring. Or how professors even survive if they don't train their students well (do they even survive?). 

This makes me think we have a ""succession"" issue in academia. The system thinks that PhD students will be PhD students forever, postdocs will postdocs forever, and professors will never grow old or retire. In other industries like say, professional soccer(or football for yall in the UK), they know youth team players become pro players, who become coaches, then football administrators or the coveted manager job. So at every stage they are preparing people for the very next step, and asking people ahead of them to mentor the people just behind them to make the transitions more efficient. Academia on the other hand, has no such forward thinking (maybe because academia isn't profit oriented). 

Since I'm basically a postdoc in any lab I'll be accepted to(even as a PhD student), I do try to have some sort of ""progression plan"" in place for anyone below me at any level (undergrad or new PhD students). I hope if more labs do this then people would feel less precarious or lost in their academic careers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/f4lgkx/dont_know_if_my_academic_career_path_is_common/,0,Good for you! ,2020-02-16 04:22:06

Let me give you another opinion though from a Bourdieusian cultural sociologist: 

Nothing says ""I don't belong"" or ""I'm really educated!"" like preemptively proving that you belong or are highly educated. 

In other words, whether you should do this or not really depends on your field (in both senses) but the higher status the field you are in, the less you want to hang up your diploma. Briefly, putting up your diploma shows that you think of the diploma as a significant accomplishment. But for an ACTUALLY high status person (not just a nouveau riche, or equivalent) getting such a credential is no big deal at all. 

So, by hanging up your diploma, you are basically sabotaging your own symbolic capital - the capital/advantages that come along with 'looking the part' and acting as if succeeding in a given field was perfectly natural and unconsciously achieved. Hanging it up might impress people - but it will only likely impress people with LESS cultural and symbolic capital than you (and therefore the people who can benefit you the least) because everyone with more capital than you will likely have the same or better credential anyway. 

Your diploma does not distinguish you from people with more educational/cultural capital than you. Rather, it distinguishes you from people with less. However, the important point here is the GROUP THAT YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF IN. 

(All of this is not completely unrelated to why people like Steve Jobs wore jeans and T shirt to investors meetings where gazillions would be discussed etc... 'all in a day's work for someone as comfortable with this status/world as I am.' It's the overdressed people who out themselves as uncomfortable, like they don't REALLY belong there.)

Of course, I am not saying all of this is NECESSARILY true (as different fields have different logics). But this is one answer that I didn't see in the comments and wanted to share - after all, you have an advanced degree now!

I am a graduate student at an evolutionary genetics lab that works with flies. As any live animal we need to take care of the flies so we try to recruit undergrads for general lab maintenance and fly husbandry, in addition to those duties, from the large scale crosses we generate a lot of data with phenotyping under the microscope. They also help with data entry which includes entering all of the phenotyping information in excel. 
Sorry for the long intro but it's important for the context. 
So new volunteer students training is a big deal. There are two grad students who are responsible for training undergrads. 


My question is how should I approach a new student dealing with a conflict? 


Today I approached a student who was late for data entry with the excuse I didn't know it was for me as you didn't adress it by name plus also didn't return her biosafety training even though repeatedly reminded her (which is the only way we can let them in the lab. So it was also a safety issue.).

All semester she has just been extremely rude to me and keeps giving me constant criticism, even though she is not my advisor. I mistakenly told her that I have a psychiatric disability and I feel like she is holding that against me, even though I do not need disability services or accommodations. 

I have a fellowship and will be teaching in the spring, and she keeps asking me “if I’m sure I can do it,” because I’m not “stable” enough. I have taught and TA’d before, and my advisor will be monitoring my teaching, so I’m not sure why she keeps insisting that I can’t teach. She does not ask the other students in my cohort if they think they can teach, and I feel like this is directed at me because of my disability and age.  I also should note that I am on medication and I go to therapy, and have not had a mental health problem in quite some time. I wouldn’t be doing a PhD if I knew I couldn’t do it. 

I should note that most of my cohort is older and I am one of the youngest PhD students in the program (24). She has also said derogatory remarks about my age, such as “you might want to wait until you’re 35 rather than 25 to start teaching.” What?

It doesn’t help that she’s the professor of two of my classes, but she retaliates against me in class as well. We were asked to prepare a teaching demo in one class and she emailed me to come to her office so that she could go over my presentation. This was nothing but criticism and she kept giving me bullshit excuses as to why my presentation wasn’t good enough. For instance, I designed my materials so that they are accessible to disabled students. She said that it wasn’t pretty enough and that I should use more color, even though I told her that people with learning disabilities are able to read black text on a white background most clearly. There are other instances where she lashes out on me which doesn’t happen to other grad students. Plus, other students in my class have noticed how she treats me and have asked me about it. 

It’s just petty nonsense and I cannot deal with the constant drama every week. She’s the department chair until next year so she gets to decide what classes I teach.

290,dl5yjd,False,Professional,3,Gap Year (pre-grad school) Employment,GradSchool,"First post, I hope this is allowed as I am not in grad school yet.

I have just completed my Bachelor's in Political Science in June, which I did really well in. I am hoping to pursue my Master's in polisci in September 2020. I'm currently taking a year in between, and I'm essentially wondering how important the work that I do in between that time is - for future employment as well as for grad school? In terms of title, job description, etc.? Or is this the period where I can just say screw it and take a job solely based on pay, not content?

I have been working at a tiny research-based NGO since July as a researcher. The NGO's mission is definitely interesting, but the pay, environment, and my manager is bad. I do nothing 95% of the time, it is extremely mismanaged. My title is great, job description is great, and it 100% looks good on my CV for the career I want (especially because prior to this, my experience has been mostly admin). It is also only a 30 minute commute (although I don't like working in the suburbs, it's convenient).

I was just offered a different position downtown, where the commute would be 1h30 each way (very long... but I'm also excited by the idea of working downtown). The company is what gets me though - fantastic environment and office, great perks and vacation, and it pays 10k more (which isn't a lot, but it's the difference in me being able to afford buying a car vs. not, for example). Right now I'm paid next to nothing.

Problem is, it's writing-based  which is sort of connected to my field, but has absolutely nothing to do with research. If anything, it's more on the comms and marketing side of things. It's definitely a step away from what my current job looks like on my CV (even if I don't *actually* do much - the description sounds like a really good first step for someone who does want to go into academia and research). The new position, although it has to do with writing, can't really be BS-ed into being connected to my field at all.

I appreciate any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/dl5yjd/gap_year_pregrad_school_employment/,1,I think the question may be if you need the grad degree to do what you want to do.

I'm super excited about it, and part of my GAship involves co-instructing a freshman class that's basically meant to teach them how to acclimate and succeed in college (go to class, manage time, utilize campus resources, etc).

Also, phone disclaimer. Sorry.

Anyway, while I do have a year of instructional experience, it's at a high school, and with very small groups. I'm guessing the class size is going to be 25-30ish students, whereas I currently have a maximum of 8 students at a time. I feel confident in my ability to get through course materials and lecture, but my current role is much more scripted than I'm imagining this to be. I didn't write the syllabus for the course I instruct at the high school, but I'll be writing it with my co-instructor for the college course.

I'm not agonizing over content because I have my teaching materials. I know what will be covered.

The advice I'm looking for is more stylistic. What can I do to make class enjoyable, and feel like more than a lecture? How can I make students feel involved in this course in a meaningful way? One idea I have is taking students out into the town so they can get to know the community better.

Also, this actually does make me nervous: I was never a college freshman in the sense that many of them will be. I started at a community college at 20 and transferred, and I'm assuming they'll be more traditional freshmen who live in dorms and are right out of high school. What was that like, for those of you who did that? How can I help align my course to an experience I didn't have?

Generic and general advice is also greatly appreciated. Thanks, everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/bgcens/tips_for_teaching_my_first_class/,8,"With such a small group, set norms for class participation from the beginning. Will your lectures be more discussion-based, didactic, experiential, or a mix? Will students be expected to raise their hands or just jump in. Do you want students to interact with each other or just respond to you? Will you call upon students at random or only those who raise their hands?

One strategy I used as a TA was “wait a minute” questions. These would be open questions throughout the lecture that students would have one uninterrupted minute to think about a response to. Even if they had difficulty thinking of anything, we could process that struggle as a group. 

As an instructor with only 8 students, make sure you know each of their names and use them regularly. Make it a habit to integrate what they share in class into your teachings (e.g., “does this remind anyone else of Twyla’s example from last week?”). Check in with students throughout the course about, asking them what they appreciate and what maybe isn’t resonating with them. Listen to what they say without being defensive and be gracious for their feedback. Students can be amazingly forgiving and supportive of instructors who they perceive actually cares about them. 

Good luck!!! ",2019-04-23 05:09:05

Research is just not for me - I just hate it, I don't have the passion and find it more annoying and stressful and don't really get excited or care really about getting good results. I came into the program not planning to pursue research, was thinking regulation, policy, teaching high school or something like community college with no research.

I've also been in the navy so have experience with a high stress long hour job and did fine there, which has immensely helped me realize it's this specific work that is not right for me.

I also switched majors from envi sci to cell bio in undergrad, so am planning to return to envi sci for a more applied job. My biggest regret is that I was in a 5 year undergrad+masters envi sci program and will now at some point need to start over and spend 2 years getting that masters degree, but try to be positive about things. The more important thing for me is that I know myself and I would have constantly been questioning whether I should have done a biomed PhD if I didn't try this. I've also learned and am sure you have whether you realize it or not a ton about juggling tons of tasks, prioritizing, time management, preparing presentations for a specific audience, etc. 

Good luck with everything and I hope it works out! If you do end up leaving for whatever reason remember this- you can dwell in negatives and view yourself as a failure that wasn't good enough. But really research PhDs aren't like undergrad, they are super fucking hard especially at higher level programs and it just means that very specific path, or maybe even just the program you're in now, is not a good fit for you.

Due to my experience in the lab (4+ years here), I seem to be a candidate for eventually taking over the lab. Indeed, at this point, the PI has already taken two steps back and offloaded many responsibilities to me (even though I am still technically a graduate student).

However, a few considerations:

* I enjoy the work, but over the past few years I've come to discover that I do **not** enjoy journal writing. My original plan was to enter industry, not become a post-doc.
* Is it normal to be concerned about the future of the lab? Since the departure of two post-docs (who have gone to form their own labs), I seem to be left holding too many of the keys.
* The funding situation is excellent, with the next several years already secured.
* The pay differential is worth considering. Personally, I would take a lower paying job to have a better work-life balance, but my University seriously gives post-docs ""the shaft"". The cost of living in my area is insane, and industry in my area *easily* compensates over double to what my University offers.

My company is offering a special partnership program with a nearby university that would allow employees of my company to basically do a Masters of Health Administration (assuming we get accepted) through the university for at very little expense to the employee (16k for full program 15,75k in reimbursement ...plus fees/books for courses), which got me really excited because I’ve always wanted to get a Masters degree/MBA. 

Or 

I could start working on applying for an MBA program at another nearby university (mainly just prep and takef GRE/GMAT). The cost would be more (not sure the specific amount), but a good portion of the program would be covered by the company’s reimbursement policy. 

I’m conflicted in whether or not to go with the MHA or the MBA, as I am not as familiar with where my business background would be of an advantage if I tried to go down the path of a career in Healthcare Administration going forward OR going to get an MBA where I have a background in business and could go down a variety of paths if I decide to go elsewhere in the future.

At various times I've put a tube in the overhead bin, let a flight attendant tuck it in a handy nook behind a row of seats, and checked the tube (I own a heavier-duty plastic poster tube I picked up from an art supply store) so I didn't have to deal with it.

I could also see you being asked to gate-check the tube if it's a crowded flight. If you're flying one of the low-cost carriers, they might also look for a way to ding you for some kind of extra-bag charge.

In all cases, make sure you've got your name and contact info on the outside of the tube, just in case you get separated. (Have a digital copy of your poster with you, too--in the worst-worst-case scenario, you might be able to get the poster reprinted at a local print show.)

I'm a PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, my former advisor owes me a semester of unpaid TA/GRA salary, and UT admin is ignoring my complaints.

I'm wondering how I should approach it because of my complicity in my advisor's wrongdoing. My advisor wanted me to TA their class, but wanted to officially hire a different student as the TA and hire me as GRA because TAs get free tuition and GRAs don't and my tuition is already paid for by other means. So I went along with this and agreed to be TA while my advisor told the department another student was the TA, since my advisor phrased it as ""we do it this way, or I don't hire you at all"". Then I never got paid as GRA. First my advisor told me it was admin's fault, they must just be slow. Then I talked to admin and they said my advisor started but never completed paperwork to hire me as GRA. Then my advisor told me they were waiting for grant money to come in, they would pay me when it arrived. Then the grant money arrived, I still didn't get paid, and my advisor said their memory was fuzzy and they couldn't remember the details of our agreement and that they didn't owe me money for teaching their class, why would I expect to get paid for teaching. I wrote this out in a letter with times and dates and contents of specific conversations and submitted it to the University's Office of Compliance, and they never responded. I sent them a second letter, asking whether they intended to respond, and they still didn't respond. So I don't have any written contract that I could take to court and the office that is in charge of policing malfeasance by staff and faculty is ignoring me. I suppose the next step is to go sit in their office and not leave until someone answers my questions. What other options do I have? And what type of trouble would I be in for going along with my advisor's plan to lie to the university about who is teaching their classes? I looked into labor laws, and unfortunately in Texas the statute of limitations for unpaid salary claims is 60 days, which has already passed, so I don't know what I might do outside of the university if University admin continues to ignore me.

* The student who, an hour and a half into a two hour exam, asked to borrow an eraser. When I apologised and told them we don't have spare supplies hanging around, they asked instead for a pencil. When I reiterated that we do not have spare supplies on hand for students, they replied, ""Well that's too bad. I didn't bring anything to write with."" 

* The student who burst into tears when told they couldn't use their laptop during the exam. ""But how can I answer anything without Googling it first?!"" 

* ""Will I get extra time for this?"" No, you will not get extra time for having to produce your ID in order to verify you aren't cheating. Just as you will not get extra time for asking to go to the bathroom, asking questions, or requesting more booklets.

I thoroughly enjoy giving talks, and since entering higher education, have been actively improving my abilities in this area, e.g., through asking for brutally honest feedback from an audience after a talk, reading books and literature on the matter, attending workshops (Alda Center for Communicating Science), and entering pitch competitions.

&#x200B;

When my labmate gives a presentation, I know he knows the topic thoroughly and has great mastery of the science, but it is also clear he does not know his audience, what their background is, and what is an appropriate level of knowledge for them to possibly learn that day.  His slides are messy (black background, full of small text), and narrative hard to follow.

&#x200B;

Sometimes we are asked to give joint presentations to the same audience, or ""split time"" on a single talk. I have started to decline this requests, as I don't like trying to merge my talk with his.  This hurts me, as I truly love talking about my science. (I kinda feel bad about this.)

- Realize that there are different ways to give a good presentation, and what works for some people may not work for others. You should be prepared to justify your advice.

- Even if you've been asked to give feedback, there's an art to doing this well. I like to focus on my experience as an audience member rather than the speaker's presentation skills (no ad hominem attacks). An example: ""I found it difficult to follow the reasoning on slide X; it would be great if you could explain concept Y"" vs. ""You were confusing on slide X; you should have explained Y"". If you need to point out something potentially embarrassing/damaging, do it tactfully (perhaps in private).

- If you are both practicing for a joint presentation, you could suggest taking turns to present and give each other feedback. Also, give praise when appropriate; don't just focus on the things that need improvement.

&#x200B;

Okay so, I'm a part of two labs at the moment (2nd year grad student) and I help run health assessments in one of them. Let's call this the secondary lab. I'm also the data manager on that project and the project lead is also a 2nd year graduate student. Everybody else on the project, besides PI, are either close to graduating undergrad or post-bacc. Enter, let's call her Susie. She's also a part of both labs, however she's a post-bacc who is interning for 20 hours a week. We have similar meeting schedules because our primary lab has regular lab meetings, journal clubs, etc. I spend more time in the lab than 20/week, obviously, because we run on a 9-5 office schedule. And, I'm here later than that regularly, as well.

&#x200B;

Circumstance: We need to enter in our availability for next month's assessments and I noticed that Susie checked that she was unavailable in the time periods that I know we have our journal club, and also the time we have our trainee meeting.

Petty: Our Journal clubs are not structured enough where we need to block that time off. If one of us is busy, we can often move it to another time. Also, the assessments can be ended early, so the time period that may involve our trainee meeting, she should be free for also.

Problem: I would note that I'm available during these times, but seeing how little Susie has available since she's not declaring availability in our mutually available times, I have a secondary-lab specific problem. If I say I'm available, more than likely me and the project lead would have to put more groundwork into these assessments and we've been trying to pass those responsibilities on to interns as it takes a lot of time out of our schedules and not really theirs. One intern has a set schedule whether she's in the lab or not and Susie has more freedom with her schedule to make up 3 hours that she'll be gone doing assessments per week. However, I love this lab and my PI. I don't want to say that I'm not available because Susie did and have this affect how much work will be put onto the leader and my PI, because that's even less fair.

&#x200B;

Advice: Am I just being bitchy/nosy or is this a valid concern? Susie has also been annoying tf out of me by non-stop talking and being non-stop ego-buffed by her advisor about a paper she's first authoring that she didn't write :/, but that's another reddit complaint post and I'm sure that annoyance has inspired this rant, as well. I'm positive that I can't let my lab down and say I'm unavailable. Do you think if I find a way to mention this within the group (not as a confrontation, more like ""this day isn't great for me because of our trainee meeting, but we can cut the time off early"" she'll get the hint via leadership? I certainly cannot afford to be gone multiple days a week for 3 hour periods at a time and the PI has an even more strict schedule, I know for sure this slowdown of data acquisition wouldn't be fair to her.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Should I call out an intern in my lab who's likely bullshitting about when she's free to help with our research project?

Update to those who helped: I followed advice to only put what I was comfortable with and also included ""maybe"" dates that Susie Cakes did not.

I basically show up to campus, go to class, take my tests, go home and get my grades.  My motivation for the degree is career advancement, rather than academic, and already my classes have helped me immeasurably at work.  However, it recently occurred to me that I'm not doing anything ""extra"", like I did in undergrad, and I'm halfway through the program. Now, granted, given the fact that I work full time in the field I'm going to school for, I don't really feel like I need part time work experience or internships, but I just feel like it would be nice to have something to put on my resume when I'm done besides my final project and GPA. I also haven't really grown close with professors who could be a reference for me. 


The problem is that the classes are huge, it's difficult to be able to talk to the professors before and after class, I live far away and classes get out late when I have work early the next morning, so I don't like to hang around after class, and they hardly respond to emails. In addition, because I work during normal business hours, it's tough to attend department events, though that is something I'm going to see if I can work into my schedule somehow. But even when I attended those events in undergrad, it didn't really help me connect with professors. It seemed like there the department size was smaller and everyone was working on the same degree, so it was easy to help a professor with research.  My grad school is much larger and more impersonal, and I'm kind of the low man on the totem pole, below PhDs and full time masters students.

Then, I would aim for a salary in line with your experience (the grade) and other salaries you find.  

I wouldn't mention the tuition reimbursement, because as a person no longer in grad school, you have a degree and that degree is worth something.

369,8fvdph,False,Professional,10,"My professor is terrible, I have no support from my school, and after finishing everything but my thesis I'm tempted to walk away.",GradSchool,"Hello all,

I’ve been debating posting on different subreddits for probably the last 2 years, but I’m a bit timid on social media and haven’t felt like it. However I am truly struggling with dealing with the stress of grad school and a major professor that I feel has overstepped his bounds. For a little background I am in my last few months of my master’s degree in engineering. At this point all I have to do is finish up my thesis. I have defended and while I passed the oral defense, my thesis needs some work.

For further background I have been working on my degree for 2.5 years now. The first year of my degree I was being paid but I turned down further payment because working with my professor is so distressing that I would rather go into debt than let him continue to manipulate me. Over the year I worked for him he continually threatened to take away my funding if I wasn’t available at any time he wanted. I mean I’d wake up to emails sent at 1 am telling me that if I didn’t respond he’d kick out of the program. I got to a point that when I’d hear my phone email notification go off that I’d break out in tears. He’s called me names (manic, a witch, schizophrenic). He has insulted my relationship and family (called my long term SO worthless and if he was my father he’d have some serious concerns about me dating the person I am). For context my SO is very caring and basically cooks for me every night since I don’t have time to make my own food. My professor has also lied to me about requirements on my degree causing me to waste 800 dollars on worthless credits. One time I tried to bring up to him how stressed I was and how I wasn’t managing the work load and he told me “This is good, mental breakdown is up here, and I need you right, here just below it.” While motioning with his hands at the levels of stress and the “correct” amount of stress being just scraping the mental breakdown line.

I have tried to bring issues up with student services and the office of graduate studies but I have received no help. I have talked to other teachers in my department (he is the department head), and have received no help. I have been told I can either bow down to his wishes or drop.

I’m not a terrible student. I might not be the best, but I am certainly not even the worse out of his students. I am the major author on a published paper and my research has received praise from many other teachers and students. I know part of the problem is I took an internship last summer and have remained there working part time. Half the reason I took it was I needed a break from the grad school mania. My professor doesn’t like this because it means that I have less time for him, but I love my job. They want me to work there full time when I graduate or potentially work at our sister site on the other side of the nation. Also I have only been in 3 credits since last spring so working part time hasn’t really taken me away from required work at school. And my professor did approve the position before I accepted it.

I am at a loss of what to do. Even with my defense last week he hadn’t read my thesis (I gave the first draft to him over a month and a half ago). He’ll flip through a few pages, see that I don’t have a schematic he wanted in the introduction, and hand it back as ‘unacceptable’. It’s a 100 page document, I think it takes a little more time than 2 minutes to evaluate. He has told me that he wants my introduction to be part of a literature review that he can publish once I am gone so even if it’s not applicable to my research he wants certain things in it. He has certain visions for graphics that I’ve tried my best to create, but they are what he wanted so he’ll hand it back. These graphics aren’t even applicable to my research half the time.

I’m just so tired. I have threatened to drop in the past, which is when I took those extra credits. The credits were for a plan B so that I wouldn’t have to do a thesis just a report. When I later asked him about things he told me that the credits ‘were just a placebo to make you feel better’. I have no help from my school and I’m so tempted to just walk away. Any advice would be great, though just writing things down has been helpful in venting.

TLDR: My professor is an ass, he has lied to me, and I have no help from my school. I really want to graduate (only have to get my thesis done), but I am also really tempted to just walk away.

There are some people in my cohort who did not write a thesis during their MAs. They made a portfolio or something of work they've done in their courses, or wrote an extra seminar paper. Here are some of the questions, struggles, frustrations, etc. they've shared with me:

-they don't know what the IRB is or what the rules are (whereas I had to figure it out and learn it from my advisors as my thesis was person-based)

-they've never written anything longer than 20 double-spaced pages and they have no idea how to pace themselves or how long it'll take them, or how to write transitions and be consistent across multiple chapters

-they don't quite understand or appreciate the method and methodology sections of papers as much because they've never had to go through the process themselves

-their work mainly revolves around theory and already-published works, which makes it harder for them to publish (at least in our field) 

This probably greatly varies by field, but in mine where we do quite a bit of qualitative research, not writing & researching a thesis puts you at a bit of a disadvantage NOT necessarily for admissions but for your progress in the program. My cohort who had capstone experiences are not as prepared as those of us who wrote 3-5 chapter theses. If you can write a thesis, definitely do it, because it seriously teaches you so much and prepares you for the kind of work you'll be doing in the PhD (the diss, of course, but other more involved studies you may take up along the way).

As of this weekend, I will have a PhD in Linguistics. I'm not going into academia, but I have an adjust gig lined up at a local community college for the next academic year.

I want out of teaching after that, so I've been looking at academic publishing. The university press in my city says they are happy to take as an intern, but it's unpaid. They said that they've had PhD interns before, and even their admin assistant has a PhD...my friend who's an acquisitions editor said this is true at their press as well. 

Between the adjuncting and my savings from a car accident settlement, and living with my boyfriend, I can technically *afford* an unpaid gig for 10 hours a week...but I'm wondering if it will look ridiculous on my resume to have an unpaid position at my level and my age (36)? Would you take this position, or would you find another way into an industry?

I graduated with my B.S. Chemistry and I will let you know what I have observed in the real world 2018 and later years. This is just my own personal observation and my point of view. If you would like to be employable the best thing to do is probably go get some work experience if you have not done so already BEFORE embarking on your PhD. NO, being a teaching assistant for an undergrad lab does not count, and NO just being a paid Researcher by your PI does not count. I mean go to a non-academic setting (which you have stated you would like) and see what the difference in culture is between doing science just to do science and get research grants & publications vs doing science to gain capital and profits. HUGE DIFFERENCE!!!!!!. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY wants to hire a PhD with no work experience in their field. If you do manage to get a job with your PhD with no work experience in that field you are either: that 0.01&#37; with great networking + LUCKY and hit the jackpot, or you will hate your life and regret ever wasting 5-6,7 years in getting your PhD. Getting a PhD without prior work experience in that field is almost career suicide in most cases, and if you did not graduate from a top 10 school good luck ever trying to land a Tenure Faculty position. I graduated from a mid-tier level school and 8/10 of the Tenure Faculty positions are from top 10 schools(MIT, Berkeley, Nortwestern, etc) for their PhD or Post-Doc.

As far as which PhD program offers better employability.... It really does not matter. It is more of the SKILLS you have gained that matters and what instrumentation + software's are you proficient in as each company is going to differ greatly in what they want. Example, a company isn't going to care if you have your PhD in Analytical or Biochem when all they are looking for is someone who has vast knowledge over Method Development + Validation using Mass Spec and whatever software they run such as Empower or MassLynx. Right now currently we are hiring an Analytical Chemist PhD level, but if someone with only a Bachelors in Chemistry that has 6-8 years of Method Development under their belt, they will be a good candidate. Versus a PhD level Analytical Chemist that doesn't even know how to use the software because they did their Thesis on something completely unrelated to the job they are applying for and have zero experience on it. Situation dictates and each scenario is going to differ greatly. 

Personally, I would go with Bioanalytical Chemistry as it is a both sub-disciplines of Biochemistry + Analytical Chemistry. I am actually going to do my PhD in Bioanalytical Chemistry. Some quick pointers! Get to know as much mass spectroscopy as you can as it is the single most powerful analytical instrument in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology. Learn GCMS if you can but the MOTHER of them all to learn that will increase your employability is LCMS-MS Triple Quadro Polar. The best manufacturers for Mass Spec most used in industry is either Waters Acquity, Agilent, and Shimadzu; so try to get to play on those. Software's to learn are Empower and/or Mass Lynx. If you do not know any of this you will struggle in landing any type of Analytical Chemistry PhD level work whether its in proteomics, drug discovery, etc. As far as pure Biochemistry, the employability is really low and I would not do it. Learn Biochem on the go on your own time and just know that Analytical Chemistry is the most employable. Good luck in your future endeavors.  ",2018-05-10 19:04:15

I was wondering how different fields feel about the idea of academic blogging. I study comp. bio. so it's fairly common for people to put up fun little projects online or put up little programming tricks and the like. 

Anybody here maintain a Blog? if so, what sort of stuff do you blog about? If not, why not and would you ever consider it?

Best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8nla2h/blog/,4,"I've been mulling starting a blog for years and am close to actually doing so. (I got sidetracked by building a website for it...) So I've put a lot of thought into it and written stuff that I haven't put up yet.

I'm in computer science (robotics, specifically) and there are a million and a half blogs out there. Academic Twitter is also pretty active. My advisor actually has a blog post that went pretty viral within the academic community and is still popular a few years on. She was nervous when it went up, because she was flying in the face of what academia says you're supposed to do in tenure track (she claimed you shouldn't work 24/7), but the response was overwhelming supportive. I know of a number of really good academic CS blogs that have interesting takes on topics. It probably won't help you get tenure, but it's definitely not looked down on.

I plan to start with it mostly being selfishly about me. By that I mean that I want to use it to help me develop my writing style and work through concepts, rather than trying to achieve something specific with it.

One topic/area is documenting things I make, for fun or research, hardware and software. It's good practice to write down how you did something as you're doing it, both for your future self and others who might be trying to achieve the same thing. It's sort of like an informal lab notebook.

Another topic is writing out explanations of things I'm learning. There's the adage saying that you don't understand something unless you can teach it. Writing out a high level explanation for lay people (or at least scientifically inclined lay people) is a great way to prevent myself from getting lost in the weeds. Also good for developing my science communication chops.

Lastly, I want to write more general pieces -- op-ed style or sharing general information like tips on applying for fellowships. I really enjoy outreach and would like to get involved in policy a bit, so this is my space for thinking about connecting to things outside the lab, like ethics, policy, society, etc. ",2018-05-31 19:25:47

I’m leaving this here because it’s something that affects all grad students to some extent. Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing.

415,cks0lo,False,News,4,Any other confused NDSEG fellows out there?,GradSchool,"I was awarded with an NDSEG in April, and I’ve been fairly disappointed with how STI-Tech was managing the awards. I’m in the process of transferring schools, and I’m not even sure if my tuition payment will be sent to the correct school, as the fall semester is right around the corner.

Then today, they sent out an email explaining that STI-Tech is now no longer managing NDSEG fellows, but another company (Systems Plus, INC) is in charge. I sent an email their way, but have yet to hear from them. Like I said, the semester starts in under a month and the timing couldn’t be worse for me.

Are there any NDSEG veterans that know what’s going on here, or at least can provide some helpful advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/cks0lo/any_other_confused_ndseg_fellows_out_there/,3,"Hi, I'm happy to have found this post. I am also a new NDSEG awardee. There is another person in my research group who will be going into his third year on NDSEG. He has told me a great history of how terribly STI-Tech managed the award with a whole host of problems. It has been a huge headache for him. So the 2019 class can at least look forward to new management of the award because it seems difficult to do much worse of a job than STI-Tech has done the past two years.

My colleague said that STI-Tech typically wouldn't pay fall semester tuition until September, which is much later than the deadline for most schools I know of. STI-Tech was supposed to notify all of the institutions that this would be the case but sometimes they failed to do this. This caused a lot of annoying email exchanges and phone calls for my colleague. Everything worked out in the end, he did not have to pay any fees and his tuition got paid, but it was much more complicated than it needed to be and wasted a good bit of his time.

About three weeks ago I called the STI-Tech office and asked when they would be paying tuition and when I should expect to hear from them regarding how third party billing will be set up. They told me that they were going to send out an email about this by the end of that week... It's been three weeks and they never sent an email about any of that and now they are apparently not in charge of the award anymore. I don't know what to make of this either and I also plan to contact Systems Plus, Inc. sometime this week.

All in all I think everything will work out in the end but I'm sure it will be a pain in the ass for all the students. I think once the transition is completed hopefully things will be better but this first semester might be rough. In the mean time I think all of the NDSEG students that are on here should keep sharing whatever information we have. As far as advice I don't think I can provide any other than just send emails and make calls till they get their shit together. ",2019-08-01 18:11:10

From another perspective, it is not in the profs best interest to keep you for too long because he/she wants to maintain his/her reputation as someone who chugs out graduate students at a healthy rate? A large grad student count also is a boost in reputation. 

Does the latter scenario seem more likely to happen to happen than the prior?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gzqa76/is_it_in_an_advisors_best_interest_to_graduate_a/,5,"It's very easy these days to look up past students and see how long it took for them to complete their degrees.

In terms of reputation...The number and quality of postdocs is more an indication of reputation than number of grad students.

I've written three manuscripts, and I've actually quite enjoyed the process for each one of them. But something I've learned is that I just totally hate what comes between completing the draft and seeing it in print. Every time for each of the three papers, it's looked something like this:  


First there were the numerous emails sent to co-authors over the weeks prior, begging for at the very least a response to my email giving their consent to submit, much less feedback on the manuscript.   


For the few that did provide feedback, there was the painstaking process of incorporating their comments when they directly disagreed with/contradicted each other.   


Then there's the teeth pulling-like process of making sure every minuscule t is crossed and i is dotted in the exact specific way outlined in the numerous pages of the journal's style guide. Level 1: centered and all capitals. Level 2: Freestanding flush-left boldface. Level 3: Paragraph-initiating boldface. Use et al in the literature cited for more than five authors. Add ""a"" and ""b"" to citations for works published by the same first-author in the same year. Kill me now....   


Then there's the re-reading the 70+ page document ten more times looking for mistakes, only to spend several more hours shoving the files through the journal's clunky submission portal and having to re-upload the thing another ten times when I find some other teeny tiny bit of something that needs tweaking while checking the rendered PDF.   


Each time I was finally able to hit that ""Submit"" button, I've had this overwhelming feeling of just wanting to be D.O.N.E. To never see that document again and be able to MOVE ON WITH LIFE.    


There's that brief period when it's going through peer review when I'm blissfully ignorant about all the ways in which my godforsaken manuscript is being ripped to shreds. All of the hairs that the reviewers are going to split about things that more often than not do not matter. All of the countless hours I'll have to pour into crafting pages and pages of verbiage arguing about the tiniest hills reviewer 2 has elected to die on. Repeating entire analyses that take weeks to run on the beefiest servers available just because some reviewer didn't like the way one of the fifty variables was calculated.   


Does this get easier? Or at the very least, does it ever start to not feel like individually plucking out leg hairs? Do other people enjoy this and maybe this career path just isn't the right fit for me? Anyone have words of wisdom or perhaps tips to make this feel less painful they'd be able to share?

This was about a month ago and I was basically gushing about the line of research I wanted to start. Probably annoying lol but I couldn’t contain my excitement and she’s in my field and knew she would understand what I was talking about. 

Apparently she talked to my advisor about a very similar idea this weekend.

I offered in the email back to everyone to meet and bounce ideas off each other but I’m so angry. I really thought she had my back. She completely posed the idea as her own. It would have been different if she had reached out and said she wanted to collaborate.

I’m so fortunate my advisor stuck up for me. I don’t know if or how I should talk to my “friend” about this. As of now, I have replied to the email confirming it was my idea and left the door open for collaboration just to be nice. 

What should I do? Should I speak directly to this person who posed the idea as her own? Let it go and use it as motivation to get my projects started? Speak to my advisor privately?

2. Plan out the sections you plan to have in the dissertation at the beginning. 

3. I had to choose my dissertation topic from a list so I don't have tips on actually choosing a topic. But to narrow down the topic you have decided on, look for specific keywords in websites such as sciencedirect or google scholar. Look for ""Review Articles"" instead of ""Research Articles"" at first since review articles basically 'review' everything already known about the topic you were looking for. It's more efficient to read through those initially rather than go through 800 research article search results. Once you finish reading through those, look at primary articles linked to those review articles that you are interested in. Then you'll get ideas of a niche in the topic of your interest since they usually mention future scope and developments for the topic at the end of those articles.

4.Take notes! When taking notes, keep a word document where you note down the article and reference of where you're taking notes from. Keep it concise and try your best to write in your own words so you wont get plagiarism when you write the info for your own literature review in the disseration. Colourcode them so they're organized!

5 . Make use of apps that make your workflow more efficient. 
My suggestions at the moment:

>Referencing software such as Mendeley, Endnote, Zotero. Many people suggested Zotero to me, and I'm loving it so far. Especially the browser extension.

>Note taking software: Notion is an amazing app for it! So many benefits. This video got me into it. It's free for personal use so definitely take advantage of this and use it guys. 
https://youtu.be/ONG26-2mIHU

>LaTeX. Many people suggested me to use this instead of Microsoft Word to make my dissertation look much better but honestly I'm struggling to figure out how to use it. There's definitely a learning curve with this that I intend to tackle.

To handle this, you likely need to add a line in the introduction mentioning what others in the field have already found on this topic (and where the gap of knowledge is), and in your discussion where you compare your findings to other papers. Sometimes you confirm previous work and sometimes you contradict previous work. If you contradict someone else's paper, it is good to discuss why this may be (e.g. we used X instead of Y, changing the context of those findings). Even if your work agrees with previous findings the discussion allows you to highlight what your study adds to the field. ",2020-06-07 09:22:36

So a bit of background: my relationship with my advisor sucks. He convinced me to switch projects from one with a working code to one with a broken code without telling me the code was broken. So, instead of generating results and trying to develop a new method, I tried to debug thousands of lines of C++ CFD code, unsuccessfully, for about 7 months.

After failing to fix his code, he informed me in my third semester that he was hesitant to keep funding me, and that I would need to improve my work ethic. I think the debugging with no results had burned me out completely at this point.

Finally, I propose a new approach to fixing his code that he still doesn't particularly like, and yet it answered some important questions on how to move forward. 

He informs me that he cannot fund me past two years. Okay, fine. I'll try to defend before that.

He informs me halfway through the Spring semester that I should defend in May. Great! Hopefully I can get it done in time; if not, I'll have to pay my own tuition to defend.

One of the founders of the startup is a professor at my institution (and a very big name in the field) and would serve as a pro forma co-advisor and/or committee member.

I am not sure if my department administration will let me do this anyway, but before I even ask I just want to do a sanity check to see if this is something I necessarily want. In particular, I'm worried about:

1. Security of funding -- if the startup does not pay me and the work I do for them will contribute to my dissertation, will my fellowship funding be safe despite restrictions on ""outside work""? In particular, I'm currently on an NIH T32, have NSF GRFP on reserve, and hope to get an NIH F31 and/or F99 in the future.
2. Managing the collaboration -- I've generally been advised that it's not a good situation as a PhD student to be the ""glue"" of a collaboration. While my advisor has indicated interest in the topic and would be happy to advise me on the work I do with the startup in addition to what we're already working on, should I expect the typical drawbacks of ""gluing"" a collaboration?
3. Career prospects -- I am very firmly hoping to land a tenure-track academic position in the long run, but obviously understand that it would help to have industry relationships to fall back on. That said, will future academic hiring committees be concerned about or even look down on these kinds of industry collaborations as long as I still publish my work in academic journals?

A situation that occurs quite often is, I'd have some concerns about the quality of our results and the assumptions of our approach, he would ignore them or explain them away, I'd run the evaluation on our results, and he would be unhappy if he doesn't see the trends he expects. 

He would sometimes reiterate to me the claims he wants to make in a paper, as if I can magically snap my fingers and make the model behave a certain way. He seems very rigid to feedback or exposing gaping holes in the methodology, and harbors this irrational attachment to every idea of his while explaining all the faults of the method with decisions I made instead. 

It makes me very anxious to interact with someone who thinks I'm such a failure, and he's not even my advisor, so I don't have to answer to him. He's just a former friend with whom I'm stuck interacting while this work turns into an accepted publication. I used to hold out hope that we could restore our friendship but I don't see that happening given he's treated me like this for two years, sometimes publicly shaming me in front of both of our professors in email form when he was extra upset.

Right now, we got our reviews back from a resubmission of this paper to a different conference and they're overall positive except for one comment. I provided the extra evaluation necessary, and now he is unhappy that the numbers don't corroborate the reviewer's complaint more conclusively. He is essentially telling me what I should have done in the past, how I should have done it, and why what I did doesn't matter when he had every opportunity to give feedback and ideas in the past when I closely shared updates with him.

This year I'm much less affected by him but the two years prior, I was having a very difficult time wrapping my head around the fact that a good friend became someone who thinks so little of me. I've gotten threats of my project being taken over by him if he doesn't see certain types of action, I've been told he will contact my advisor directly if I don't respond to his requests, I've gotten authorship threats (implying I could be shifted to the back or omitted from author list altogether).

I just wanted to share some light to the good PI's. So, if you have a good PI, please share why they're good, how you knew they were good/met them, and any stories about times they've been good or went above and beyond for you. 


I'll start. (I'm a MS student if that helps)


I met a PhD candidate whos research I found interesting. We discussed how I could add to it and the PI they work with. They helped me get on that PIs radar. I met with them and we were all on the same page on how I can contribute and do my own thesis.


The PI and I have weekly meetings on my progress and next steps. At first I was getting discouraged because we'd always have bits in the meetings that were along the lines of ""Why did you do it this way? Thats incorrect."" Or ""Why is the focus on this? Try this instead."" But he ALWAYS pointed me in the right direction and answered all my questions respectfully and in detail. He also listens to my ideas and has generally accepted them. Even though I do my own research for application of methods, I always learn something new in our meetings.


Now that I'm more in tune with how he does things and how the project works, the bits of meetings that discouraged me are almost nonexistent. Now he always ends the meetings with something along the lines of ""This is great work Gerbaily. Great job this week. I can tell you put in a lot of work and we are progressing quickly. Keep it up."" He's awesome and I always feel proud after our meetings. It keeps me motivated to continuously do work and do just a *little* more before our next meeting. I'd hate to let him down!

Times are tough these days and remote research has been a struggle for us all. Sometimes I forget how lucky I am to have such a good mentor, so this is as much a reminder to myself as it is an anecdote for everyone else. 

I got interested in his research as an undergrad, as he was one of the only scientists on campus working in a somewhat niche but rapidly expanding field that I wanted to get into. I went to his office hours to introduce myself, and we ended up chatting for a bit about his research. By the end of the semester, we had spoken a few times, and I was pretty sure I wanted to join the lab as an undergrad volunteer. 

I remember asking one of his TAs what he was like to work with, and I’ll never forget the response. The first word the TA used was “humble”. Not smart, not innovative, not funny, but humble. And that stood out to me. The TA, who I had a lot of respect for and who’s class I enjoyed, told me that the PI listened and was receptive to other people’s ideas and suggestions, that he was down to earth, and that he was easy to work with. 

So fast forward, and I’ve been in this lab for about a year now. Sometimes my PI scares me, but I know that behind his intensity, he means well. He is receptive to feedback, and he lets us learn by making our own mistakes. Another grad student once told me that my PI was more likely to watch me struggle for 6 months that to come right out and tell me I was making a mistake. I know that’s not the ideal environment for everyone, but I am thriving under his guidance, and I have so much respect for him as a scientist and as a mentor.

I wish I knew exactly what kind of research I wanted to do, but frankly it's all equally interesting and uninspiring at the same time. It's hard for me to get excited about research just from reading a paper. I prefer learning about science through talks and such. I'm the kind of person that will become interested in just about anything so long as it is presented well. I'm afraid that I'll overlook a great lab because I can only base my decision off of lab websites and papers.

It doesn't help that when I met with my first year advisor, I presented a list of about seven PIs that I was interested in (I made this list just from an initial gut reaction when reading the research summaries on their websites), and my advisor gave me names of another six PIs I should look into. So now I have this long list and I don't know how to narrow it down. Maybe I'm overthinking this decision since I'll have three rotations total, but I can't help but feel that I can't make an informed decision from the papers alone (since as I said before, they just don't do it for me in terms of getting me excited about the science).

I will also reach out to students who have rotated in these labs to ask about the lab environment. I'm struggling with the science aspect of this decision.

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/grhoik/what_is_the_difference_between_ethnographic_and/,1,"First, you might need to clarify the distinction between methodology and method. A methodology is a given approach to research, specifically its epistemological and ontological commitments to knowledge production. A method is a specific technique used to produce knowledge and it needs to align with the methodology. So, action research is a methodology and participant observation could be a method one uses in such a study. 

Qualitative research is a very broad, and sometimes contested, term that generally refers to any research that produces knowledge in ways that do not rely on numbers (e.g., statistics). Ethnography is largely considered to be one of the first qualitative methodologies, and through it emerged a set methods (e.g., participant observation) that are now used in other qualitative methodologies (e.g., action research).

480,g6szq4,False,Research,5,Horrible workplace/lab environment during COVID... is this treatment normal??? Help!!,GradSchool,"Hello all,

I work in a psychology/neuroscience research lab (have been there for about 3 years right now, 2 years full time 1 as an UG). I want to get my PhD in clinical psychology, planning on applying for it this cylce.

I fully understand what I have signed up for in this position- long hours, tough days, hard work, being at my PIs beck and call, etc. I don't have a problem with any of that, my team and I are dedicated to what we do and advancing our careers. However, since the COVID crisis has begun, the environment has changed in a dangerous way.

My lab is human research on cannabis, and because of the legal restrictions we have a pretty innovative research design that involves us running participants in a van. The nature of the study is running a baseline appointment at our office and then driving the van up to 50-90 minutes away to run the participant at their house so they can use the product. This appointment is a total of 3-4 hours in the van with 3 of us in very close quarters- two RAs and the participant. 

Naturally, running human subjects during this time causes a lot of anxiety. We are worried about our own safety and the safety of our participants. Our study presents a unique challenge/risk because of the design- if you are in a small enclosed enviroment with no windows with two other people for 3 hours and one of you is sick, all three of you will be sick by the end. Not to mention we are doing 3 seperate blood draws in the van, so even closer proximity/working with biohazardous materials. 

In March when this all first started, my PIs did not understand why we would be concerned about running appointments. They told us that we had nothing to worry about because we are young and would ""probably get it anyways"". My coworkers and I finally took a stand and they agreed to back down temporarily- luckily, the University closed operations that same day and all employees were sent to work from home.

During this work from home period, communication has been horrible (it's never great, but particulalry horrible during this period). Our bosses have made many comments downplaying the severity of this crisis/making us feel hysteric for being concerned (Note: our bosses have never once run a van appointment, it is a team of 3 of us for my projects that run everyone. A typical week they want to see is us in the van daily, running 1-2 van appts a day). These incidents are just the tip of the iceberg but overall we have been given no reason to believe that they are looking out for our best interests/health. 

A few days ago, we found that they want to send us back to work, as early as May 4th. It is unclear what this means but from their vague statements to us it seems like they want us to begin running participants ASAP- in the van as well. We don't know what kind of PPE we will be recieving, or what kind of protections will be in place. There will be no way to confirm if any of us or if any of our participants have the virus because we do not have the testing capactity. We are located in Colorado, where cases and deaths are still rising daily and we are nowhere near the testing capacity we need to be (testing has actually plateaud for the past month). Our governor (for some fucking reason) is easing social distancing restrictions/beginning to partially open the economy on Monday the 27th (even though he has acknowledged this is against public health reccommendations, we will probably see a spike in 3 weeks, and might have to go back to shleter in place). It seems like our bosses are running with this and trying to re-open operations despite the science saying we should move very very slowly. 

So far no one has asked us how we feel about this- we are hearing these plans from various sources, and being left in the dark. The people in charge of our ""safety"" plan are ones who don't run appointments/interact with participants. The risks of human research in this time seem high, but even higher for our study protocols. My coworkers and I are terrified it will get to a point of having to lose our jobs because we do not feel safe performing them. I feel like I am facing a choice between endangering my health or potentially derailing my career. I/my co-workers have put up with a lot of bullshit at this job and worked our asses off to get where we are, but we are not willing to risk our lives/well being just to collect 3 more data points??

Sorry this is so long but... my question really is- **is this normal????** If you work in a lab, how is your lab handling COVID? Is anyone else experiencing anything like this in their lab?? Is this treatment of employees normal/ok in anyway?

I have delved deep into the opportunities that stand my way due to my Life Sciences degree and am starting to feel lost.

It's just how risky getting into research is. You have mo surity of employment,  and may as well get stuck as a permadoc well into your 40s. That's more than 15 years of your life. Faculty positions are pretty hard to come by , that comes as no surprise.

Wasting away your youth engaged in gruelling work where u are not only underpaid , but also underappreciated. There's always the fear of not giving results or not receiving another contract.

488,g1co0l,False,Research,5,Going to completely fuck up my MSc thesis proposal and the relationship with my advisor,GradSchool,"I have to submit my MSc thesis proposal in a few days and it's going to be a DISASTER.

Simply put, I thought I only needed to submit a vague research topic that I would then develop more thoroughly while reviewing the literature and such.

Turns out, it has to be a detailed 6-pages proposal where I have to state my research objectives and questions, my method, the state of the art and some references that I will use. I wasn't really aware of this - I mean, I had the document but I wasn't aware of the level of detail I was required to get into. Part of it was poor communication, part was due to me procrastinating and being unmotivated to do anything due to this covid crap which has deeply affected my daily life (I live in a hard-hit area). 

This has also affected the relationship with my advisor, who has been SUPER nice so far - I was really trying to make a good impression on him but I utterly failed and now he thinks I'm a dumbfuck who cannot work like a goddamn adult (and rightly so). 

I am supposed to scramble this project together in less than 3 days, but I don't even have a clear topic in mind and I can't just submit whatever because my advisor wants to see it first and then I'll have to defend it in an online meeting with my committee who will question me about it.

These are crucial deadlines and if I don't meet them, I don't graduate.

My anxiety is through the roof and I cannot concentrate. I'm seriously thinking of giving up altogether because I don't see any possible way to get out of this mess.

489,gdl8ot,False,Research,3,Should I try to get my PI to change my project?,GradSchool,"Hi everyone. I'm a 4th year PhD student in biology and I'm having some issues with a project. When I first joined my lab, my PI gave me a really exciting project on a topic I felt comfortable with, aligned with my current interests and career track, and immediately got to it. Funds were low at the time, enough to support the research but not me, and I was TAing to support myself, which greatly reduced my time working on research. My PI somehow got a grant for a different project that he's not very familiar with (it's a pilot grant) and gave me this project to do concurrently with my main one. I have done so for about two years now and I've found that I am really not interested in the topic. I don't like the project, I don't like the people I have to work with on it, it doesn't align with my ideas for the future, and because it's a pilot grant in a new area for us, we are going in basically blindly with no collaborators. I was producing subpar data and have found no meaningful results so far.

As such, I was happy when it seemed like we were ditching the project because I'd be able to focus full time on my other one, but my PI is now wanting me to apply for a fellowship for the second project and is looking to apply for a full grant in it with a collaborator. I don't want to continue this project but I understand that having funds to support me and the lab might need to take priority. However, I'm very concerned that if we get the fellowship and/or grant, I will have to leave my first project completely for this second one and I know that this will make me unhappy. I'm also worried that given our negative data, it'll be very hard for me to publish good papers and graduate.

So my questions are: should I mention to my PI that I am not interested in this project? Do grad students in general have that amount of say in their research, specially when there's low funds? And if so, how should I go about this? I'm terrible at confrontation and don't want to sound like I'm simply dismissing the project because I know this is my job.

495,g4kzcu,False,Research,6,Awarded NDSEG - Advice about entering a new program for PhD? *Marine Science/STEM/US*,GradSchool,"I was just awarded the NDSEG, which will fully fund me for three years as a graduate student with a great stipend. For reference, I am a second year graduate student in a marine science program that I love. Before receiving this award, I had decided to defend my MS thesis and work for a few years before getting my PhD. I set a defense date and have been interviewing for Masters level jobs. My field is molecular microbiology and I study social interactions in bacteria, but I would be interested in focusing more on microscopy work and field-based ecological studies.

Since I was planning on doing a PhD at some point, I feel like the NDSEG fellowship is too good of an opportunity to pass up! I absolutely love my advisor and department, and if I were to stay in my current program I could finish my PhD in the three years that I now have funded. However....I don’t love the research I am doing. I have been in my lab for >5 years already (undergrad, lab manager, and now graduate student), and I’m just ready for something new. My background is in microscopy, bacterial genetics, and molecular microbiology. I would love to incorporate more microscopy into my work, and given that I am in marine sciences I am looking for more opportunities to do field work. 

So this leaves me with three options:

1. Decline the NDSEG and defend my MS, as I had originally planned. Given that I intended on doing a PhD at some point, I no longer feel like this is my best option.

2. Complete a PhD in my current program. Although I don’t love my current research projects, I have a fantastic relationship with my advisor and I can appreciate that this isn’t always the case in academia. I have also already completed my quals/classes/etc. so the rest of my time in this program would solely be doing research.

3. Defend my MS and enter a new program for my PhD. This would give me the opportunity to find a research project that I am really excited about, but I am concerned about the timeline. I only have until 4/29 to accept the NDSEG, and obviously I will not be able to travel to visit programs/advisors right now because of COVID. This is very short notice to find someone willing to accept a new graduate student, and I’m weary of joining a new lab without having met with my advisor in person.

Does anyone have advice about how to handle this situation?

Imagine you want to include this as an excerpt because you don't feel that any other sentences do an acceptable job of conveying what you're trying to convey. How do you do it?

One common way to sidestep the issue is to paraphrase instead of quote. You'd still cite Hodder, but Wallerstein and Rice wouldn't be mentioned at all.

I recently left grad school with a masters because after working on a continuation of someone else’s project, I discovered that this person fabricated most of their data. I could not reproduce anything they did, nor could three other lab mates or my advisor. Once I found irrefutable evidence of fabrication, I presented it to my advisor, but they were incredibly defensive, denied everything and ultimately told me “Well X saw the phenotype and saw Y, Z results, so you should be able to do the same thing.” X being the person who fabricated the data. I ultimately left feeling pressured to fabricate data and decided to get the fuck out of there. I should also mention that part of my advisors argument in response to the fabrication was “Well none of its published,” as if this makes it any less unethical that this person fabricated data?!? I also learned after I left that my advisor is poorly respected by others in the field, specifically because other researchers question the integrity of their findings. 

Now I’ve left, graduated, already started working a job I love and my advisor has asked for all my data. I know this is common practice, but I know they plan to use my data to publish a paper.

Personally I think that you should give him the data. I assume 1. You will report them regardless of whether you give it or not. 2. Any type of research on the data YOU did was ethical, and by this I mean that whether the information given to you was fabricated or not, your results would still be the same. 3. If they did publish the results, it is because they want positive light on them. If you do not agree with their findings and said you don’t want to be a part of a publishing, they will most likely not put you on. It would look bad if an author came out and said you know your own work is fake, and also if they are already unethical, they see no harm in taking some extra credit for your hard work. 

Not giving it to him will cause more problems that you do not need as you have a new job and do not plan on pursuing a PhD (?), giving the potential that the previous advisor could bring up that you refused to give data back with no other explanation.

I am currently undertaking a 10,000 word dissertation for my final year. My thesis gravitates around the major obstacles to small business success in the United Kingdom. I have found the appropriate data sets to answer my research questions, however I am not sure how to approach the analysis of this data. I was told that regression analysis would be a great way to dissect my data, however the nature of my research questions are not compatible with regression analysis. Furthermore, I've never been taught how to property do regression analysis (I only have a vague idea of what it is. The main issue I perceived is that I cannot find a value for my variables)

I have heard that qualitative analysis is great for open-ended surveys, but the survey that I found is pretty close ended (again, I'm not sure... I really suck when it comes to research methods). The main question asked is, ""What would you say are the major obstacles to success to your business?"" and respondents are asked to choose from 10 options. So, I was wondering - how can I qualitatively analyse closed-ended surveys? Is it possible? Or better yet, do you have any suggestions on how I can approach this data?

Goals: 

I’ve always been interested in finances and the business side of the company. 

We don’t have a large number of professionals in our career field (Occupational Safety) that peruse advanced degrees so I feel like this would be a great advantage for me. 

I’m mostly interested in an MBA but would also consider a Master’s of Science.  

My idea is this degree would be great to put me on track for a Director position, Vice President, or any equivalent Executive position. 

I have the potential to open my own business later on down the road and I also do real estate investing so a program where you have some solid business takeaways is a must. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Given I may have to pay for this out of pocket I’m trying to find a balance between a reasonable cost and a program that has a good reputation. 

Is this realistic? Or should I just be looking at this as a check in the box and networking opportunity? 

I don’t even understand the rankings. 

It’s tough to rationalize when my undergrad is already making me 100K with 50K upside potential over the next 10 years. 

I’ll be working full time in the DC area while perusing this so it’ll have to be a part time or online program.

I will consider doctorate level degrees down the road after. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Does any specific programs jump out?

I understand most MBA’s have a specific focus right?

Do all programs require the GMAT or GRE?

Anything else I’m missing?

The field/lab portion of the study have relatively low sample sizes as they were completed entirely by myself over the course of 2 months during one summer (through an NSF REU program). Without going into too much detail, the field study was plagued with issues outside of my control and ultimately the data and hence the manuscript feel lackluster and ambiguous. However, besides cleaning up the discussion section and some basic formatting, it’s a completed manuscript.

Now my advisor has suggested we completely remove the field study from the manuscript. It was not intended to be a standalone study and without the field experiment, it loses any context that MIGHT make it meaningful. Not to mention that I’d have to rewrite most of the manuscript if we proceed with the lab study only. The whole thing feels like a garbage fire and the edits I’ve received are minor and almost entirely stylistic. I’m not making real progress and don’t know how to get the guidance I need to make progress and this feels like a huge waste of time. 

My advisor and I only communicate via email due to geographic distance and the longest email I’ve received from him in the past year has been around 5 short sentences.

Many many undergrads don't publish their REU work. The purpose of these sorts of programs is less to produce publishable research and more to give undergrads a taste of what research is like. If your advisor thinks the field study isn't publishable, he's probably right. Which doesn't mean it was a failure. It means you learned a lot and your field research will be better once you start your PhD field work.

That said its not like a low h-index means the PI is an engaged and capable mentor either.  Honestly an online index is not what you want, you want to get in contact with someone in their lab and ask them what its like to work for the PI.    


Also the thing that is really critical is if you are interested in the specific research that lab is conducting.

559,ei72rc,False,Research,10,Failed Dissertation Defense: Need help with writing resources,GradSchool,"So, yes, I am that 1% who failed the dissertation defense. As I am picking up the pieces and trying to organize the 7-page document with 89 line items of changes, I am hoping to reach out to other grad students to try to find more resources for a successful re-defend.

First off, let me say this: I take 100% ownership of the failure. I put together the committee. I hired my editor. My name is on the paper. I also pushed for a compressed timeline. I did the defense. I was the CEO (so to speak) of this study. It's on me.

I also see this as an opportunity to make it even better.

&#x200B;

Here's what I think happened...

My committee is made up of a chairperson who is in my program of study (education policy), a person in the education department and then an expert in the field of study. When I got to my defense and I finished my presentation, things quickly went south. I was hit with questions about what the purpose of my study was, and how it didn't line up with my presentation or paper. Then my grammar and writing got picked apart. Finally, I was told I was going to have to re-defend.

The biggest thing was that my expert was expecting a much different paper based upon my proposal. However, my dissertation chair was the only one who was allowed to edit and comment. I ended up going with a conceptual framework based upon the chair's feedback, and the expert panelist wanted a model. Secondly, they picked apart my grammar, saying the writing was terrible. I did send it to an editor and have been working with an editor for the past 2 years (I am dyslexic and have some issues with sentence structure). However, it was still sub-par. Finally, the system is flawed. This particular program only allows the chair to give feedback and edits. The other two committee members do not get the paper until prior to the defense. So if your expert is not the chair, they might not see it until 7 days before the presentation.

&#x200B;

So, here's what I think I need (I am open to all suggestions)

1. A new editor (possibly found one)
2. A professional dissertation advisor/writer. Does this exist? Is there somebody that I can hire to help me look at my data and help me organize my writing process?

My current program's structure doesn't work. The proposal is supposed to be our first 3 chapters (intro, lit review,  methodology), but depending on what you find during the study, this could mean an entire re-write. The paper was disjointed in the end. The lit review didn't match up well with the findings.

3) Resources for better sentence structure. It's been 30 years since I had to do sentence structure. As an adult, is there any resources for basic sentence structure and writing?

&#x200B;

Anyways, just writing this all out has helped me organize some of my thoughts. Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

I think I would call it a ""dissertation coach"" or ""tutor"" not a writer. I get what you're saying about wanting help with your writing process and someone to guide you and that can be totally fine. You want to avoid the word writer though because that makes it sound like someone will do the work for you, which can count as cheating.

I'm sorry you have to do your paper again. How long is your timeframe this time around? It sounds like your paper may not have been terrible but that your presentation and paper didn't line up, is that right? My first step would be to talk to my advisor about next steps: rewriting the paper from scratch? Rewriting the presentation? Rewriting both to have the same theme? You could loop in an editor in these talks, too, but I wouldn't hire an editor to do any work until you know you're on the right track because you don't want to perfect a paper that you're just going to have to re-write.

I'm a dissertation editor with about 10 years of experience. I would be happy to provide you with a quote and a sample edit but I would be hesitant to do much without seeing the comments on both your paper and your presentation. I'd also want to make sure we had a solid plan going forward and would hope that your advisor could be looped in on the plan or reviewing each chapter, because I wouldn't want you to waste a bunch of money and turn in a nice paper that would just be rejected because of content. We can talk about what to include and work on strategies for writing and organizing but there's only so much help I can offer with content, since my expertise is in clarity, commas, and cohesiveness (and APA style, and semicolons and blah blah blah) not arts education. I can point out areas that don't make sense and make sure you follow a theme and prove points... anyways, if you're interested, let me know. Other good places to find editors are the Editorial Freelance Association or ACES The Society for Editing. There are some other associations as well. What's nice about those is that the members are usually at least lightly vetted for editing experience so you know you'll get an experienced member and you can search for experts in certain types of editing, like academic/dissertation editing and some might even have an arts focus.

565,eu3m8p,False,Research,5,Is it too early to switch advisors if I just finished my first semester as a master's student?,GradSchool,"Hello. I'm aware that questions regarding changing advisors has been asked frequently on this community, and I've also asked a few of my own previously, but after doing some thinking on the answers that I've received and read I felt that I needed some opinions or feedback regarding my situation.

I just finished my first semester as a computer science master's student but have been having doubts about staying in this lab for quite a while. The main reasons that I'm having feelings of doubt are:

1. Different research interests. When I first interviewed with the professor the research that he said I'd be doing was different from what I'm doing now.

2. Differences in approaches to research. My professor is more ""business-oriented"" (for lack of a better word) and only cares about the results (more specifically, I'm doing research in deep learning), while I want supervision on how to analyze those results in-depth.

3. Differences in values and principles (I'm not sure if this is an accurate way to put it). This is somewhat related to #2, but I've noticed that most of the people in the lab share an attitude along the lines of results-first. This attitude is somewhat understandable, but again it's not exactly how I want to approach my research. I've been ridiculed when people saw I was taking classes in the mathematics department, saying that ""you don't need those classes for deep learning.""

4. Lack of supervision in general. My advisor's always attending meetings and doesn't do any research of his own. The most advisory that students receive is either during our lab seminar or right before we're about to submit papers to conferences/journals.

Some of the things that are holding me back from making up my mind are:

1. Perhaps I'm just having feelings of frustration and don't know particularly well what I really want to do yet, and should give it some more time. My parents (who are both professors themselves) have said that it might not be a bad idea to take another semester to think on my doubts, and whether switching advisors would solve any of those problems.

2. Money. The lab that I'm at now is the largest in our department (even school maybe), and the professor does do a good job of bringing in government or company-funded projects. The students including myself usually get paid on a monthly basis, and we use this money to pay for our tuition with a bit extra. I'm aware that this isn't typical for our school, and the lab I'm at is privileged in that sense.

3. Fear of starting over. I'm not sure if there is any objective reason for me to feel this way, as it has only been one semester. I suppose the reason why I feel this way is because I want to get results out within the next two years so that I can apply for PhD programs elsewhere, and switching advisors gives me this massive feeling of anxiety that I'd be throwing away everything I've been involved in until now.

What would your advise be to someone who's just started graduate school and is already having these feelings? Would they be justifiable or perhaps I'm just acting like a child? Switching advisors isn't a trivial issue either, so any second opinions that I may receive are greatly appreciated.

My background is CS and I'm conducting research on deep learning models (this is so common these days Inactually feel kind of weird saying it). Anyway, I told my advisor on Monday that I'm going to opt out of my integrated program and graduate with a master's, and also apply to PhD programs abroad this year.

He advised me that I should really try and get a publication with me as the first author out before applying, as it's not typically expected that master's students have their own publications (unless you're going for the ""top schools"") but that it would really help me make a difference, and even if the submission doesn't work out it'll be good experience.

Long story short, I'm currently involved in three research projects. I'm starting to think that focusing on one and dropping the other two will be a good idea so I can focus. The projects to be dropped I don't really see myself doing long term anyway. The submission date is less than two months away btw.

What would you do if you were in my shoes? I'm still a bit on the fence.

Another thing is that finance/accounting field can get very intense on mathematical/quantitative stuffs - while CS is more about programming. 

I have read both fields' papers and projects. CS deals more with real life and finance/accounting is like...I don't know, maybe sometimes they just publish the papers to get tenure, it doesn't seem to benefit the life of anyone.

The first was a tiny lab with a somewhat micro-managey PI, and the second was too high-risk in its research focus and had very long graduation times. 

My third rotation, which just started a week ago, felt like it clicked immediately. It’s a huge lab (like 40 people, around 15 are grad students) with a strong social bond. Extremely well funded and a very translational focus (my preference). The PI is supportive, obviously a bit busy, but according to his students he makes enough time for them, plus they all help each other deal with issues. All the students I’ve talked to seem very happy and have good work-life balance. Most students graduate with at least one high-impact first-author paper, often C/N/S. My project is fascinating as well.

What are some other factors I should consider before committing to this lab?

577,d5h753,False,Research,28,Being railroaded by a territorial peer-reviewer,GradSchool,"Guys, I am beyond infuriated right now.

So I submit a manuscript and the reviews come back. The first reviewer enjoys it a lot and makes helpful suggestions, the second goes on and on how I did not take into account the theoretical state-of-the-art of the field and that I need to rework the theory section to use it as a foundation. They then cite 5 papers (all with a common author and none with more than 1 or 2 citations from anyone that isn't that author, CURIOUS) that we ""need to use"". I review those papers. They are unclear and meandering, dense and almost impossible to parse, utterly useless for practitioners, which my paper is aimed at. But most importantly, *the theory is not even applicable to my paper because the author makes a fundamental assumption that cannot be applied to my work under any circumstance. In fact, logical extensions of my theory would render their theory obsolete and I could easily write another paper demonstrating this*.

So I write up a polite, but firm response letter detailing why the reviewer's requested changes will not be implemented and send the paper back. This paper has manuscript status logs and according to them, the reviewer returned their second review 12 minutes after confirming the invitation and wrote a two sentence ""review"" that just restated what they said the first time without any acknowledgement whatsoever of my response, claiming that I ""ignored"" their comments. So they didn't read my response obviously.

We once had a reviewer trash all of the published experimental data that we used to validate a model. Data that as well cited by others, came from multiple sources/labs, and spanned 30+ years.

     I want to propose a study that focuses on language attrition of people’s L2. I haven’t yet decided what linguistic feature I want to focus on, maybe you can suggest something. I was considering syntax or lexicon, but if you have a better idea please let me know.

     Anyways, I want to see to what degree people who have some degree of mastery of the language but who have not used it in a while (I’m thinking 1-2 years maybe more?) actually experience significant language attrition for a specific linguistic feature like their knowledge of the syntax of the L2. 

     I think that possibly when being tested normally they show signs of significant attrition, but I want to see if they actually experience that much or if they unconsciously can still properly, for example, remember certain lexical items that they don’t consciously. 
     I want to find a way to trick them into showing that they actually can do more than they consciously think they can. I was thinking about this because of how much easier I have found and others I know to speak another language when you are drinking. Obviously I am not going to propose getting participants drunk, but I’m wondering if any of you have an idea on how to do so. 

     I know this is very vague and may be stupid, but this is my only idea so far for a proposal for my ESL Theory class and it’s due on Wednesday. I’ve been focusing too hard on my sociolinguistics study 😕 at least that one is going well lol.

It was approved by my PI, everyone knew I was leaving, yet at 9:05 am on the dot Monday morning I receive two frantic emails from an undergrad and my PI.

592,eazr6i,False,Research,4,How to Support a Friend Who Might be in a Position to be Taken Advantage of?,GradSchool,"So I have a friend in my lab who is entering her last semester of her Masters while applying to PhD programs.  She wanted to stay here at our school and enter the PhD program we are in, but our advisor essentially told her ""apply elsewhere."" :( It's fine because she technically wants to do research in a different field, so she went and fortunately got another professor in our department to give her a chance.

I'm happy for her, but a friend and I are worried.  Essentially, she will be working for this professor unpaid as a Masters student, on a project that two other Masters students have already failed at.  I'm confident she can succeed, but this professor has told her that the chances of getting into his lab as a PhD are ""low.""  My other friend who is also her friend already has a Masters and expressed concern that this professor could be using her for unpaid labor and could just as easily dump her, no matter how hard she works or whether she succeeds, at the end of the semester.  My friend even cancelled her Christmas vacation to stay here and do a literature review for the topic so she can hit the ground running next semester.  I so hope that she isn't just spinning her wheels for nothing.  She works hard and is a competent researcher who deserves to be here.

What I want to know is, in the event our worries are confirmed, how can we support her?  Do we let her know about our concerns now?  Do we say nothing to avoid putting negative thoughts in her head, and simply look for signs just in case?  If so, what are signs we could look for as outsiders looking in?  What can we do if we end up being right and come next semester's end that professor hangs her out to dry?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/eazr6i/how_to_support_a_friend_who_might_be_in_a/,2,"You're the type of awesome friend that I want to always have.

Even if this new lab turns out to be exploitive, she has the skills and resourcefulness to survive it and do well, and she'll learn a couple of things from it that she wouldn't have otherwise.

My PI throws me under the bus to my committee and, without offering me any advice or direction, will be the first one to say, ‘I told you so.’",GradSchool,"Hi everyone, I feel so lost. My committee always rips me to shreds. Mostly it’s just one of my committee members, but everyone else silently agrees by not offering counterpoints or helpful suggestions. Worst of all is my PI, who not only agrees with the committee member that is annihilating every last shred of my project without offering possible directions to go, but also goes out of his way to tell me he has felt the same way for months, but wanted to wait until I had a committee meeting for everyone to find out.

I’ve pioneered several technologies in my lab and have acquired a lot of data (nothing really publishable since all of it seems to be negative data [aka a bunch of things don’t have effects]). However, scraping together a publishable unit seems daunting. I don’t want to spend more time here only to publish in a lower tier journal. 

I already have my Masters from when I defended my oral prelim. I don’t have a paper showing the wide range of techniques I have (techniques I was hoping to leverage in finding a career in genetic engineering). However I worry that staying here for 2-2.5 more years will hurt my career prospects.

I feel like I have no feedback. Until it’s too late. I sincerely think I’m not cut out for science or experimental design.

Should I cut my losses and leave with my Masters or is trying for a publication that showcases my technical abilities (even if it’s in a shitty paper In a shitty journal) worth it to get a subpar PhD?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/cc64w2/after_5_years_i_feel_no_closer_to_graduation_ive/,118,"Are you required to publish to graduate? If not, stop worrying about it. (It will look better if you can publish, but there's no point in accumulating stress about it unless you are required to do so.)

Do you have enough statistical power in your data to claim negative results? Convincingly demonstrating that something does not work is difficult, but valuable, even if people don't get excited about it.

My program generally advises people to stay a year or two longer if it yields a PhD or an additional publication; the post-doc clock starts immediately, and is limited by universities and major funding institutions in my field to prevent interminable post-docs.

I also have a complicated, messy data set without crystal clear results.

I am struggling with how to build a dissertation out of what I have. I have learned that one's dissertation need not be ""publishable"" although that does make the process easier. It does have to be based on the work of the author (as in, one cannot staple in a 4th author publication, but the contribution to that work can be incorporated).

I was recently able to get my PI's attention and discuss what the chapters of my dissertation might look like, and he provided some useful insights. He indicated that writing up what I have spent my time on is a viable option, even if it is not publishable (or not publishable in a high class journal, or is only publishable in a methodological journal). We are supposed to be learning how to independently conduct research, so the lack of feedback is somewhat expected, but you might find it helpful to speak to others who have graduated, take a thesis workshop, etc.

My department coordinator set up a meeting with me to help me find resources to graduate. Maybe your department can also help you find guidance outside your committee.

An overly ambitious project that I can show is technically feasible will become a technical chapter in my dissertation; I plan to explain how one could actually do the project by modifying some aspects of the design to greatly speed up the data collection process. I spent a lot of time on this, but it just didn't yield a scientific result because the project was poorly designed. Ironically, my PI's attitude towards this project changed from enthusiastic to negative over time, but he still wants me to include it.

Although I get very frustrated and negative about my situation at times, I keep trying to remind myself of positive interpretations. My data was collected under inconsistent circumstances beyond my control, which is less than ideal. However, whatever I do find should be fairly robust due to that inconsistency. Also during this analysis and result-searching process, I continue to learn new and interesting things, which is something I enjoy (despite being annoyed that I would prefer not to conduct science this way). Furthermore, as I am interested in maybe pursuing data science as a career, finding a few useful stories in my data seems like a valuable training exercise, which will make a good story about overcoming adversity and finding value in a mess for later.

One student in my program discovered after 5 years, that all his data was noise due to faulty equipment. He graduated 2 years later after even more research without the noise problems, although his mental health suffered a lot.

As a last resort, you might be able to reform your committee and even switch labs and get a new mentor. After an advisor in my program basically ruined the life of his nearly finished grad student (by abruptly rescinding the position, and therefore the visa, of this student's lover roommate and fellow lab mate), this student was allowed to transfer to another lab and finish. Rebuilding the committee is a fairly nuclear option, but it might be possible (although you mentioned below that this might be problematic -- at my school in this circumstance, the recommendation is to speak to the dean of students, who hopefully is not an old drinking buddy of your PI).

You might also write a draft of a paper and give it to the PI. Publishing more is better, and it is harder to say no to a manuscript than a nebulous plan. Finding famous people who have published things in less-than-stellar journals might also lubricate the process, in case your PI's ego is in the way of a lower tier publication.

A workshop I attended suggested looking up dissertations from prior lab members. This can provide an idea of what the PI considers acceptable for graduation. (If you have never read a dissertation before, it is worth doing. Some of them are surprisingly rough.) We have a ProQuest database of dissertations on our campus. ",2019-07-12 04:28:20

612,dchnb2,False,Research,9,A bit of a garble about advisors after graduation and a small FYI,GradSchool,"I am 10 months out of grad school. I got out by fighting and clawing against a pretty rough advisor (fighting over edits (that he forgot he did) sabotage (his employees were told to do it) and poor understanding of the data and what we were trying to show (I’d say equal parts naughty here)).  

But I finally did it. It was bad enough that I left my field (but not science!) to find a job. He emailed me several times asking when I was going to publish, but I didn’t answer back. I hate his editing (he doesn’t actually read and then gets made later and makes you rewrite months of work on a whim), he made tons of promises he didn’t even come close to keeping, and then let others sabotage my lab space (not that it was secure enough for micro work in the first place...but that’s my mistake for not fighting it earlier).  He didn’t agree to let me graduate. That was another fight on its own. Luckily for me, every one signed off and I was able to get free. So like I said, rough but done. I did it. (Sorry for the rant, it’s things I can’t quite say to him yet haha)

10 months. Several emails “just checking in” on me unanswered because I am still dealing from the damage done. I have a job in a lab doing things completely unrelated to my field, but damn, money in the bank (seriously it’s still a bit lower then middle class but it’s more then grad school Hahahaha)! 

And then he sends an email letting me know if he doesn’t hear back he’s gonna publish my work (copy/ paste from my thesis) and add me as co-author.... with out input for how my work and data are used?!!

Whaaattt we didn’t even agree on what my data said and now were all the sudden publishing?!? 
Can he do that?!? 

How do I respond? He’s copied two people from my committee as well??? What the heck is going on here? I start to spiral back into the ridiculous unhealthy mindset that I had been healing from away from grad school. Freaking out- typing up really angry responses and deleting them- like over and over seriously not even sure what I am saying.

Then I remembered - I’m not alone!!! I called my undergrad advisor (super great full for ‘em) and said how the heck do I respond????

 He gave me some great advice- 
1. Unless you signed a contract saying he owns your work- he can’t publish your work with out proving he “couldn’t find you”. (I am certain this was his plan since I didn’t respond to his more buddy buddy emails). 
2. Don’t email back in the chain. The other people have a stake in getting the data published- they need to know that you can no longer work with your former advisor due to personal reasons. You can explain what happened to your data with out going into detail. (I didn’t find out about the sabotage until after I graduated when an employee told me about what they were told to do)
3. Call the other people publishing on this paper and ask them what they want to do about it. (Like, do they want to do the edits maybe so I can continue to write? Do they want to be the bridge?)

I outlined the Results based on Chapter 3's findings. Decided to use the method of ""Causal Mechanism"" through qualitative research method to find if factors are significant or insignificant.

622,dxl3mj,False,Research,2,Will the research activity during my Master's program seriously impact my PhD or career path?,GradSchool,"## TL;DR
The lab that I'm at now has recently been heavily focused on one specific field of research, and I'm also expected to conduct research activity in that field and squeeze in time to work on things that I personally want to pursue later as a more serious PhD student and possible career. Will my research being heavily focused in an irrelevant area impact my future prospects of applying to PhD programs?

## Long version
I'm currently enrolled in a Master's/PhD integrated program at a Korean University. The lab that I'm at does AI/deep learning research. My personal interests lie in computational linguistics, and I made it clear to my advisor that it's what I want to pursue and I wanted to work with those in the field at his lab, which he was happy to hear. I also told him that I have plans to complete my Master's here and go for a PhD to the US. He recommended that I finish my PhD here and go for a postdoc abroad, but that he's also ""more than happy to let me go if it's what you want.""

Recently, he's really taken a ""passion"" into this thing called ""AI-driven drug discovery,"" where you're basically using deep learning techniques to find which chemical compounds may potentially become new drug components. It's interesting and important for sure, but it's not really what I had in mind when I first came to the lab or what I imagined to be doing later in life.

The fact that 1) I'm fluent in English, and 2) I'm ""technically enrolled in a PhD program"" and so will be at the lab longer than regular Master's program students has caused my professor to take a liking to me and him and other senior lab mates have really urged me to at least take a look into the field of bioinformatics. I thought ""what the hell, I'll give it a try and if it's not for me then I'll talk to my advisor and back out."" It is a bit naive of me to think that backing out of research I've been engaged in will be easy.

I've talked to other seniors at the lab about my concerns, and they all understand where I'm coming from and advise me to ""do the bare minimum to keep me out of trouble"" while spending all my time and resources doing research in things I want to and prepare for applying to PhD programs abroad (publishing papers, attending seminars and conferences, etc.)

I'm still a bit concerned though, as bioinformatics is a little distant from computational linguistics. My undergraduate degree wasn't even from a STEM field or linguistics either (international relations major and computer science double major). Has anyone either been down this road, or seen anyone go down it? From a professor who's seeing my application as a potential PhD candidate, how would it look if much of my prior research is in bioinformatics when it says I want to do PhD-level research in computational linguistics?

A bit after the deadline, NEU accepted me to their MS in Robotics program, but it was too late. Further, the total cost of NEU (tuition + housing) was looking like it would be about $20k more than WPI - a bit too steep for me to consider doubling back.

But then today NEU sent me a letter saying I was awarded a substantial scholarship. Now its looking like the total cost of NEU is going to be a $5-10k less than WPI, depending on housing expenses.

Some questions:

Is doubling back on accepting an offer bad? Am I massively burning bridges or raising red flags or anything here?

In my own financial interest, is it possible to use this offer from NEU to ""haggle"" with WPI, especially since there's like a $25k difference in tuition? Or is that idea just as fucking stupid as it sounds?

Are there other considerations I should make in regards to this decision?

* I've looked extensively at the curriculum of both programs, and it seems like the stuff I want to study (computer vision) has similar levels of support at both schools.

* Since I'm going for MS in order to transition from one professional field to another (from radar EE to computer vision CS), I'm not sure how much weight I should put into evaluations of professors and labs and research and such

* Also since I already have a few years of professional experience, I already have a life in Boston. I wouldn't mind Worcester, really, but most of my friends are in Boston, I've become used to living here, and I think I would be a little sad to leave knowing I had the option to stay.

* NEU's Co-Op program + summer internships also could provide financial income to cover even more of the cost that I'm not sure I could cover while at WPI.

Really any advice would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/graq7z/already_accepted_one_offer_of_ms_with_no_funding/,7,"Hello!

I went to WPI for my undergrad so I have some mixed feedback I can offer. I also studied biomedical engineering so I’m not as familiar with the robotics program, although I know it is highly regarded both internally and externally. With regard to the curriculum at WPI I can say they absolutely do a great job of teaching you real and applicable skills that will make you stand out from graduates at other schools when you rejoin the work force. After WPI I went to brown for my ms and I had far more practical lab skills than some of my peers from other schools. 

At the same time, the graduate program is simply not a priority at WPI. All of the aspects that sets them apart are focused on the undergrad experience. I also know they are going through a bit of turmoil right now with their president and the treatment of professors with many having already quit and others searching for jobs because the school is in massive debt to fund its seemingly annual expansion projects. 

That being said, the name also carries clout in the field of robotics (I believe they were the first school in the country to offer a robotics program) and especially in New England. They also have a strong alumni network in the area and in my experience higher ups in companies from WPI love to hire WPI graduates. Although the same can probably be said for NEU. 

I hope this was helpful and didn’t add even more to you confusion! In terms of going back on your acceptance, don’t worry about it. You have to do what’s best for you. You’ll lose your deposit but if you think you’ll be happier in Boston with your network of friends then I’d say it’s worth it.

So today I found out the Graduate Assistantship of my dreams turned me down, not sure if it’s because of budgetary reasons or they hired someone else.

The program itself is fairly expensive and many of us are using a combination of traditional loans to pay for the courses and grad plus loans to help supplement our income and pay for living expenses etc as it is nearly impossible to work full time and maintain the grade point average required to stay in the program.  Our financial aid also does not include our summer courses even though the amount of courses over the summer is considered full time by federal guidelines (over 6 credits considered full time and our summer courses average 9-10.) I spoke with financial aid about the summer courses and they had no idea that the traditional loans don’t cover them.

We just had a meeting to discuss the process of signing up for and paying for (!) immersion hours which costs $8,000 and is not covered by financial aid. I think this is unfair and ultimately our school is under reporting the cost of attendance by tens of thousands of dollars per year (including summer course) and doesn’t report this cost for immersion hours. 

This school is in an already expensive state with a high cost of living and state and federal income tax so working part time doesn’t cover all that much in the way of expenses. Lots of hospitals offer something in the way do education costs but it is not competitive and many offer less than $2k per year (less if you’re full time.)

I’m trying to figure out what my best course of action is.  The vast majority of us in the program are taking out loans but they basically don’t cover the cost of tuition because the school isn’t reporting accurately.

I'm an incoming SUNY student. I lived in NY for a number of years and am a NY resident. However, the school requires me to show continued presence for 12 months up to the start of school. The issue is my lease in NY ends in Feb 2020 and I don't plan to move for school until June or July 2020.

I finished a M.S. in engineering back in May and I'm taking a year off. Recently, I began applying for jobs and PhD positions. A few days ago, I was talking with a professor at a Canadian university (I'm from the US) who was looking for a PhD student to work on a project that was a perfect fit for my interests and background. I asked what the stipend was, and they told me it was $12,000/year, which they said was ""competitive."" I asked if most PhD students have second jobs, or if there is cheap/free on-campus housing for PhD students, and the prof said no to both.

Now, I had two main issues with that.

* My partner and I were already struggling on $40,000/year (collectively) as master's students, with both of us studying at the same time. If my partner couldn't find a job in Canada, I don't know how we would survive on $12,000/year.
* That's $1,000/month. Basically I'd pay rent, utilities, and groceries, and I'm mostly out of money.

Where I did my bachelor's and master's degrees PhD students are paid around $30,000/year. What is a normal stipend? I can't imagine $12,000/year is livable, but maybe I'm coddled.

Hubby and I are moving to San Diego this fall where I’ll be starting a PhD program. It is fully funded with a $34k (pre-tax) stipend, and I also will have subsidized housing through the university. I have no debt but he has $35k in student loans at 4.2%. We expect he’ll be making decent money once we move there, entry level jobs in his field are around $50-60k and the area’s job market is quite strong. We also have $20k in savings.

Our plan is to basically live off of my stipend and put most or all of his income toward debt payoff and savings/investments (and maybe the occasional vacation once his loans are gone). Here is our proposed monthly budget based solely on my income:

Income: $2833

Taxes: $300 (estimated based on an online calculator; I will not have to pay SS)

Rent: $1100 (includes utilities/internet)

Groceries: $500

Eating out: $100

Car: $0 (paid off, though it’s pushing 150k miles so not sure how much longer it will last)

Car insurance: $150

Gas: $75 (I will commute by bike, he will likely drive)

Phone: $50

Gym: $45

Health insurance: $0 (I’m covered by my university, he’s on his parents’ plan for the next year and hopefully his future job will offer insurance)

Fun/misc expenses: $300

Total expenses: $2620

Based on this budget we should have enough to live on via my stipend, with a bit of a buffer for unexpected expenses. His loans have a $200 minimum payment so we can always tap into our savings if he ever loses his job for a while. 

I’m not local to the area, so I’d like to know whether our proposed budget has any flaws or things that I’m forgetting?

I'll be moving to Lafayette, Indiana for my doctorate degree. I'll be renting an apartment for the first year but its seems due to limited availability I'll be moving in to apartments that do not provide good service and take away deposits for ""cleaning"" when vacated.

Seeing that I'll be new to a country - USA, I'd like to know what to look out for and not to screw myself over from these people. 

Please advise on:
1. What to look for in lease agreement
2. What to do if the equipments and service mentioned do not function and are not repaired when asked
3. How to claim the deposit back without it being taken away.

Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/caxmyg/housing/,1,"I lived in a ghetto apartment that did the same thing to me. They charged me a cleaning fee and I asked the office staff if they were going to replace the carpet if I paid the fee and she said no, then I get a bill in the mail for $300 to replace the carpet. I didn't pay it because I do not owe it.

When you move in, you will be given a form to fill out in which you are to document the condition of the apartment when you move in. I would go over every inch of that apartment in explicit detail and note every crack, scratch, wear mark, stain, discoloration, and anything that is not otherwise pristine and perfect. You might need additional paper, because the form they give you does not often include enough space. If you have to send it back to them in physical form, go to the post office closest to you and send a certified letter. This will require someone to sign for it and you will get a receipt, so they cannot claim they never received it because you have a receipt showing that the Post Office delivered it to their mailing address, and someone signed for it.

While you are doing this, take pictures of everything and then send them to yourself. Save them in a dropbox folder or something so there is at least one backup location.

As far as what happens when equipment is not repaired, put in work orders and call the office. You'll need to check your local laws, because in some places, residents can pay for a third party to perform services and then bill the landlord. I had a roach infestation in my apartment because the next door neighbors were hoarders, but the landlord took forever to send an extermination team out there. It was only after I threatened to call an exterminator myself and then deduct the cost from my rent that they sent someone out immediately. Work orders and follow up emails are a paper trail, so if they fail to repair things that could impact the living conditions of the apartment (i.e. heat is out for an extended period of time in winter) then that would help you in the long run. If you're worried about dirtying the carpet, you can buy plastic placemats or rugs on amazon for relatively cheap. Because of my experience, I'll never live in an apartment with carpet again.

Your landlord also just can't refuse to return the deposit. They must notify you regarding the reason they are withholding your deposit. If the reasoning is not justified, or you have evidence to the contrary, you can probably sue them in small claims court, but this can be a long process and you should make sure the evidence is in your favor before pursuing this route.

You should also not be afraid to discuss problems you're having with professors you become close to, because they might know something or know someone to talk to. That's how I found out about a tenant resource center in my town.

723,apytjj,False,Finance,5,Things I learned while refinancing my student loans,GradSchool,"At r/GradSchool most of us have student loans of some sort, so I wanted to share some things I learned from refinancing my student loans that no one seems to talk about. I hope to save you some frustration and a lot of money! At worst, at least you'll have something to benchmark.

Some background - I powered through 3 business degrees and got a good paying job, but I now my \~10 loans are near repayment. 

Credit score ranging from 710-765.  I have 140k all with federal set rates ranging from 3.4-6.8%. Refinancing was definitely a good idea. I ultimately ended up refinancing most of my loans through a combination of SOFI and ELFI (through credible)... see below the underwriter is still MOHELA for both.

1. There's a lot of options in appearance, but in practice there's only a few loan servicers.  MOHELA and Navient (Sallie Mae) are big ones. Most of the websites like SOFI, Credible, ELFI, are just intermediaries, they are *NOT* the underwriter. They do not make the decisions and your loans are still going to be handled by one of the big companies!
2. Companies like SOFI and ELFI are going to have very different terms. Their customer service is mostly BS.  For example, SOFI calls themselves a conservative lender but then has very aggressive payoff schemes where you have to payoff your loans in 5 or 7 years to get the best rates. 
3. The customer service of these intermediaries is worthless, despite how friendly they may be.
4. At the end of the day your income, your credit score, and your overall ability to repay affects your rates... these companies will not share their formulas with you.  *It is in YOUR best interest to spend time playing with the numbers.*  After I verified income, my rate went down and I was thrilled, so I asked for a larger loan (specified another loan), and despite multiple reps assuring me that my rate would not change. Guess what?! It did and it probably will for you. SOFI then tried to get push my application through and attested they had no recollection of a lower rate.  Call them back/modify your application. I removed the other loan and my rate went back down.  Even a 0.25% at 15k is about $40/year, and this stuff can really compound.
5. Your credit score will take some big hits for the process. Two companies, two hard hit and I lost about 40 points. This is the scummy part of how credit works.
6. You might want to consider multiple companies. Aggressive and conservative. I did 25k at a 4.7% rate for 5 years and about 60k at 5.4% for 15 years. This gave me a good mix.  Overall, I will save \~$800 in interest my first year alone. 
7. For academics, these servicers are clueless.  When they verify your income, they use monthly... meaning that if you're paid over 9 months... *cha-ching* for you. They will multiply one month by 12. 

I am not recommending any particular company and only outlining my experience with information I wish I knew beforehand.  This was an incredibly frustrating process but worth it with the savings in the end.  Hopefully, my info/story will help you.

Thanks in advance",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/axapaf/funding_in_foreign_countries/,1,"ti rispondo in italiano

se vuoi fare il dottorato in USA ti consiglio caldamente di fare anche la magistrale in italia, per 2 motivi:

- i colleghi americani fanno 4 anni di undergrad mentre noi solo 3 anni, e la maggior parte dei programmi richiedono 4 anni di studi universitari

- devi avere esperienza nella ricerca: noi purtroppo facciamo solo la tesi, che dura 1-3 mesi per la triennale, mentre i colleghi americani cominciano fin da subito a fare ricerca (i cosiddetti REU) e una volta laureati hanno già 4 anni di esperienza; facendo la magistrale guadagni altri 6-9 mesi di ricerca per la tesi magistrale (meglio ancora se riesci a pubblicarla)

una volta che hai queste cose in saccoccia puoi cominciare a cercare le università che ti interessano, vai nei siti dei vari dipartimenti di fisica e vedi se ci sono prof che fanno ricerca che ti piace... ogni università ha il suo sistema di application ma le cose comuni a tutti sono:

- TOEFL in quanto straniero

- transcript della tua carriera universitaria (un documento in cui ci sono i voti in tutte le materie e i tuoi titoli, tradotto in inglese)

- almeno 3 lettere di raccomandazione, scritte da tuoi professori/relatori/tutor ecc, ovvero gente che può testimoniare le tue capacità di studio, ricerca e insegnamento

- statement of purpose (la famosa ""lettera di presentazione"") in cui dici chi sei, che esperienza hai, perchè hai scelto quell'università ecc ecc

- la succitata research experience: oltre ai periodi di tesi, cerca di fare tirocini/volontariato in laboratori quanto più possibile

- alcune università ti chiedono il GRE, un test standardizzato del cazzo che costa un fottio, io personalmente non l'ho fatto, se puoi trova anche tu posti che non lo chiedono

considera che il metodo di selezione è molto diverso da quello italiano, non c'è un punteggio che ti viene assegnato, ma è piu un sistema ""olistico"", come dicono loro, guardano all'insieme: per esempio se hai voti bassi ma piu esperienza, sei avvantaggiato rispetto al secchione che ha la media altissima ma non è mai entrato in un laboratorio... diciamo che loro vanno più a ""fit"", devi saperti vendere

First, having spent some time in both Tallahassee and Tampa (as a resident or longer-term visitor to people who lived there) Tampa is way more sprawl-y with lots more traffic and more areas that are, say, strictly commercial. I'd do a little research on the Tampa area to make sure you're comfortable with the commute times, areas within your price range in relation to distance from school, etc. Tallahassee is pretty quick and easy to get around, not to mention fairly inexpensive, where Tampa may not be depending on where you live in relation to USF.

Second, are either offering funding? If so, how much? How is tuition in comparison? Less debt is often better.

Third, and probably most important (especially if you're expecting to take on significant debt) is: how's the job placement after school? If the placement rates are about the same into similar-prestige positions, than the cheaper option is probably better. If one costs more but results in better jobs/jobs more to your taste/jobs that pay better, than that needs to be taken heavily into consideration.

Tuition cost isn't a factor since work is paying for it (yay!) Here is what I perceive to be pros and cons right now but if anyone can add to these or correct my assumptions that would be great

VCU

Pros: Older program est. in the 90s, Great reputation for health sciences and probably the best reputation for MPH in the state (VA as a whole doesn't have crazy good programs but whatever), good reputation for their epi program, cheap or potentially free cost of living if I decide to live with my mom, Richmond is my hometown so I'm very familiar with the area and still have friends there, Connections with state dept of health and state capitol being nearby, research focus on tobacco use which is line with my personal interests and background.

Cons: Generalist program (no concentrations offered), health policy dept doesn't seem to do much with the MPH program and that's the field I'm more interested in, I've heard rumors that the PhD program is disorganized but the MPH program ""should be fine"" and VCU administration is a bit of a clusterfuck

UVA

Pros: Offers health policy, law, and ethics concentration that appeals to me, opportunity to get a degree from the best public school in the state, new experience with living in Charlottesville, connections with the Batten School for Public Policy, stronger potential for networking with alums if I decide to get involved with politics, new data science school is forthcoming

Cons: Newer program as of 2007 with un-established reputation, a bit higher cost of living compared with Richmond, do not have many current connections with the city and probably wouldn't want to stay there after I graduate

I'm like 99% sure I'm going accept my admissions offer to go to grad school at my alma mater, UIUC.

They offered me a tuition waiver, which is amazing. However, I still need to find a way to cover the costs of food/housing. I obviously filed the FAFSA months ago, but I guess they can't tell me what financial aid I'm getting until I enroll for courses (according to their acceptance email)

The only problem is, I can't register for courses until their new student welcome event in June.

How am I supposed to sign a lease for an apartment next year if I don't even know what aid I'm getting? 😢 I'd rather not wait until June to sign a lease, but I also don't think it would be the smartest idea to sign a lease before I find out what my financial aid is. My family's EFC is 0, so I'm dirt poor.

Even if I somehow don't get any need-based financial aid, I would only need about $7000-$10000 to afford the cost of food/housing/textbooks for the one year that I'd be in grad school. I was offered good aid from UIUC (tuition grants) during my undergrad and I only have about $8000 in student loans right now. 

I was offered about $20,000 in loans by another grad school (that I'm not attending), so if I was offered that by another school, do you all think it would be likely that I would be offered a similar amount by UIUC?

744,a1c5rb,False,Finance,0,"Free food etiquette, ""from the other side""",GradSchool,"I am also a grad student and I like to eat. I have attended events where free food was a big part of my motivation, and I often eat my fill. And I like providing people with food and hate food waste.

However, now that I have been helping my advisor organize a conference at our school, we unfortunately had to ""kick out"" a few people who came just for the food and did so in a stupid, arrogant and/or disruptive way. So I would like to give some guidelines to new students at my school, and generally everyone interested in free food, to increase chances of actually getting food and avoiding getting kicked out and awkward situations. Of course, this is open to discussion and criticism, but here's what I've come up with from this experience:

\- If the attendees are paying to attend the event (e.g., it's a not-only-internal conference), you most likely can't just enter and help yourself. Don't try to lie your way in, or at least not in a stupid way - don't say you are an organizer / an organizer's student, because these people asking you who you are at the entrance are likely to be the organizers' students themselves or to call and check. There may be a back door through which you still can enter...

\- In any case, if you intend to mix in with the attendees, dress appropriately so that you don't stand out too much: at least it needs to be clean, without visible holes, and fancier than old sweatpants+sweatshirt. The standards may be higher if there are important guests (e.g., professors) from countries with higher clothing standards, such as most of Europe and Southeast Asia, and some organizers care to not be embarrassed about that. \[I am in Israel, where this especially needs to be said, but this should also be an important notice for many students in/from some other countries such as the US.\]

\- Eat politely and moderately enough to not attract attention. If there is only a little food (compared to the number of people present), don't try to stuff yourself, but only take one serving (until the attendees have finished eating).

\- Don't say anything offensive or controversial; if someone tries to make small talk with you, usually the best strategy is to get them to talk about their work.

\- If it is a sort of a sit-down meal, if tables and chairs are provided especially for the event, most likely the chairs and cutlery are counted and extra people will be noticed, and a problem as some of the actual attendees won't get a sensible place to sit. I just sent such extra, unregistered students (and some registered students who brought them) to eat in the hallway, where there happened to be some more tables and chairs, as we had a plenty of food so the only problem was sitting space, but some organizers may be less accommodating.

\- Usually the safest, easiest and most reasonable strategy (especially if you can't dress and behave properly and/or are in a totally different field of studies) is coming right after the meal, i.e. right after the beginning of the following lecture, after the attendees entered the lecture hall, and helping yourself to the buffet leftovers. Politely asking the servers, cleaners and such staff about leftovers should also be fine (unless you are in a place where the local law forbids it). Obviously, don't try to fill leftovers containers while the attendees are still helping themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/a1c5rb/free_food_etiquette_from_the_other_side/,25,,2018-11-29 00:25:42

I’m hoping to go to grad school for a position that needs a grad degree in order for me to practice. (Licensed Mental Health Counselor)

I’m planning on going in 18 months after saving enough money to not take out any loans in order to go.

Currently I live in a HCOL area in affordable housing (read: about 20% of my income) and make about $52,000 a year. My job is manageable and provided good health care and benefits but not what I want to do for long term.

The decision is this:

I could apply to a state school program of which only 6 people get in each year, where I have to take two courses at a community college and a GRE before applying. The program costs $26,000 in tuition over a two years being a full-time student. I would have to move to the town where the school is (and housing is more affordable there) but I would have to quit my job and give up benefits. The kicker is, I have the options of working as a Teaching Assistant and having that pay for most of my tuition. So the program is essentially free minus what I need to stay alive, which isn’t much. Also, I could not get in initially and have to wait another year before applying again.

OR

I could go to CityU, pay $52,000, rolling admission and more lax application process but the program is three years and designed to be done while working a full-time job. I wouldn’t have to quit or move, and I wouldn’t get the opportunity to teach college classes.

Do I go through the hoops and try to go to the practically free full-time program or do I try to balance both work and school to pay for a more expensive part-time program but would hopefully get to continue working at my job?

I know this is probably a “well do what you value more” kind of question, so if that’s where you’re leaning please tell me what you would do in this situation.

I only have around 5k in savings and the school didn’t offer me any scholarships. In fact, only a few people in this program are offered scholarships and they are pretty small (around 13k). I obviously knew all this when I enrolled but reality has begun to set in and I’m having terrible anxiety about all the loans I’m going to have to take out over the next two years. 

My anxiousness has me assuming that everyone else who is going to grad school is in a better situation than me. I think they must have more savings, have rich parents or they must have gotten hefty scholarships. 

I’m not looking to be told that I made a bad decision. I can’t turn back now. I just want to know if anyone else out there is in a similar situation.

754,8g263m,False,Finance,13,Loan my way through Grad School to avoid work?,GradSchool,"Greetings /r/GradSchool,

I'm going to be entering grad school this fall to attempt to get my Master's in Computer Science, and I had some questions about loans that I can't get a consistent answer on.

Essentially, I want to focus my time and energy on school and really make it count.  I'm going to have to take out loans to pay for tuition and most likely to supplement my cost of living (since I will no longer be able to work full time while going to school).  The question then becomes:  should I just get loans to cover my entire cost of living for the duration I'll be in school (~2 years)?  I (optimistically) plan on having a decent career coming out of school, so significant student loan debt seems worth it, but I'm not sure how others feel about it.

I've talked to friends who have been/are in grad school, and their experiences are varied.  Some have taken out significant loans even during undergrad (I currently have 0 student loans), and some paid out of pocket while working during grad school (albeit, in a program that might not be as intensive as the one I'm going into).

How much is too much?  Or should I plan on working half-time during the semester?

I'll also note that I'm dismissing any possible scholarships or internships for the sake of simplicity and covering my bases.  Essentially I'd like to know that I have everything covered going into school, and anything I can take off the top I will as I go.

Thanks for any advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8g263m/loan_my_way_through_grad_school_to_avoid_work/,3,"I took out the max loans the first year of my Master's, in an effort to try and avoid working so I could focus on my studies.

755,8l0wi2,False,Finance,10,Is going for a Doctorate Financially Worth It?,GradSchool,"For the following year I have been accepted into a prestigious PhD program with a TA position which will cover three years of coursework. Thus far, I have not acquired any debt or have taken on any loans. I will be going straight from a BA in Music Education (as of a month ago, I'm a fully certified K-12 music teacher) to a PhD in Musicology (a field I'm very passionate about and may want to teach at the college level).    
    
Right now, I consider myself to be in a very good financial spot for someone my age. I've been saving my money since I was 16, and have a nice bank account to show for it (nothing too crazy, but much better than many of my peers). After speaking to a myriad of professors in the program, I've been told the average amount of time taken to graduate is 5-6 years, meaning that if I fall into the mean, I will take on 2.5 years worth of debt. The school is a public institution whose tuition is not too high ($11,000 per semester), but by the time I pay the tuition for multiple years, have to pay for living expenses, etc, I feel that I will be deep in the hole. I have the option to only opt for a Masters, which would be fully paid for, but I feel that would be less fruitful that a PhD, and does not expand my horizons by much. My bachelors degree allows me to teach, which means I am not necessarily set for financial ruin if graduate school does not work out, so at the very least, I have financial options and I love to teach.     
    
tl;dr: Does anyone who is currently on, or has completed a PhD have any insight regarding personal finances. Although the first several years are paid for, the thought of being debt free to potentially six figures in debt is scary.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8l0wi2/is_going_for_a_doctorate_financially_worth_it/,4,"Congrats on your acceptance.

I don't know what the norm for Musicology is, but I would not do a PhD that wasn't fully funded for at least 5 years.  I would personally feel uncomfortable with six figures of debt and a PhD, which may or may not pay a salary that would allow me to pay off the debt easily.  I would think long and hard what your career goal is and if the PhD is needed for that.

There are a few things I thought about before going back to for my PhD: earning potential, debt, and retirement.  I'm in a very different field, but overall, while you're doing a PhD, that's at least half a decade of lost earning potential that you could have gotten with a full-time job.  Also, during those years, you will not be able to contribute to an employer matched retirement fund, and may or may not be able to contribute to an IRA.  And, you are debt-free right now, so you don't need to worry about interest piling up on existing student loans while they're in deferment.

Ultimately, it's up to you whether this debt load is worth it for the intellectual challenge and possibly a college-level teaching gig. ",2018-05-21 13:43:19
756,8jojcx,False,Finance,10,Opinion on living situation/budget for grad students,GradSchool,"TLDR: 1000 rent and utilities, 20 minute commute vs. 500 rent and utilities, hour and half commute - 2300/month stipend.  Can I afford to break the 30% rule?

I'm starting my PhD program this fall.  I will be moving an hour and half drive away from my husband who is going to remain at the job he loves and eventually move to the city with me once he finds something that will provide comparable pay and job satisfaction.

As for me, I will be receiving about 2300 a month from my fellowship, and I've been looking at 1 bedroom apartments or the option of living with a friend short term (6 months - 1 year) in her condo, while I wait to see if my husband finds something.

If I go with the 1 bedroom apartment, my finances will look like this:

* income: 2300
* rent: 850
* utilities (including internet): ~150 (it gets cold in winter)
* phone: 50
* car insurance: 75
* food: 200
* IRA (I'm being pushed to almost max it out): 400
* renters insurance: 15
* Hulu/netflix/amazon prime: ~30
* Cat: ~25
* Commute: 20 minutes on bus since there is no parking on campus during weekdays

If I live with my friend temporarily, I will pay about 500 a month in rent/utilities (instead of ~1000), but I will need to commute an hour and half on the bus since the bus route and transfers to and from her condo are clunky.  Other expenses should look similar.

Is the extra 500 worth it for a much longer commute as a 1st year grad student?  Will I be okay with almost half of my income going to rent and utilities (when the recommended percentage is 30%)?  I'm reluctant to get a roommate because I don't know when or if my husband will find a job over the next year and I'm not comfortable living with someone I don't know.  I also find it difficult to live and function under extremely noisy conditions, so I'm trying to find quieter buildings.

I should have a solid 3-4 month security fund saved up (if I were to live in the 1bed apartment), and I don't have any debt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8jojcx/opinion_on_living_situationbudget_for_grad/,3,"I make a bit less than you do monthly ($1900 or so after taxes) and pay probably $800ish per month on rent and utilities—over 40% of my takehome pay.

As somebody who has done three hours a day on public transportation to get to class before... absolutely do not do that if you can avoid it. It is super draining, and in grad school, time is your most important resource. The 30% rule is meant to be a benchmark of sorts and doesn’t really work for all situations (particularly city living). I would also maybe put off saving for retirement at the level you planned here if you can swing it. I don’t get any retirement benefits from the university like matched contributions but I try to throw a few hundred dollars a year into my Roth IRA. It’s not a ton but it’s more than nothing, and it’s really all I can swing at this point. I know I’ll have to be more aggressive about saving later in life but the point of what I’m doing now is to prepare me for my future career in which I’ll have a higher earning potential.

758,8yf6ke,False,Finance,5,Should I take a break after graduating with my B.S. and how should I optimize my break time if I do?,GradSchool,"Please be patient if I sound ignorant, I’m the first of my intermediate family (including aunts and cousins, and great aunts etc...) to even make it to college, with some of them not even graduating high school. So I’m a little foggy on this situation. 

So here’s my story - I’m a commuting student that will be going into my senior year next year. And to put it bluntly I don’t think I’m financially ready to pack up and go to grad school, assuming I’ll even get in. 

I’m taking a hit with a 2.9-3.0 GPA after a freshman year that was basically worth nothing after transferring and a personal disaster my sophomore year after I transferred, although my  junior year alone is a 3.5. Since I commute and work so much I have trouble finding comfy internships and experience, which is important in my field (animal science). 

I currently work at a job related to my major, and I have experience at shelters, vet clinics, campgrounds (teaching children about animals) , and I’ve completed 2 independent studies last year and have one lined up this upcoming year, all related to animals. Although I feel like this isn’t enough. 

I want to get into an M.S. program for my major but, as mentioned above, I don’t feel anywhere ready. I can’t even afford the GRE right now, no kidding. 

I was wondering if it would be wise for me financially and academically to take a break. I want time to get more experience and credentials, take my GRE, and even visit my desired schools (which costs a TON of money). 

Would a break year hurt my chances of getting in? Should I go back and fix some classes or gain more experience? 

Any and all insight is appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8yf6ke/should_i_take_a_break_after_graduating_with_my_bs/,1,"You don't sound ignorant - it's a good thing that you're thinking about these things now. I got my B.A. last year and took this past year off because I felt burned out and needed a break. I also didn't want to pile on grad app stress onto my senior year, so that's another benefit to taking a gap year to consider. 

Academically, you sound like you would be a solid candidate, so I don't think taking a year off would hurt your application. If anything, I think taking a year off, in giving you some more time to work on your applications, might be helpful (especially in giving you time to study for the GRE). It's also good to go in with a plan for how to continue building on your relevant experience in that year. For me, that meant taking on a job building from my tutoring/teaching experience, and presenting at a conference, which wasn't a lot, but both were good outlets for me to do what I'm passionate about. 

Financially, I'm very glad I took a year off to have a chance to save money for a future move and grad app fees - though you should definitely look into fee waivers for your application fees and GRE. When it comes to school visits, I would echo what another commenter mentioned - there's a good chance that there will be a Welcome Weekend type event for a program you get into, and they usually cover plane fare, etc. 

When it comes to saving (and I didn't quite realize this in the past year), there are some things you may want to keep in mind for a potential move. This depends on where you end up, so some of these things may not apply for you (I'm moving across the country for my program): 

* security deposit for an apartment 
* plane ticket/traveling costs 
* a decent suitcase 
* shipping costs 
* first month's rent/expenses 

I've been able to save for most of these things, and I'm thankfully not worried about my first month thanks to my parents agreeing to give me a small loan, but I know a friend in my cohort is struggling with moving expenses.

I did this because I no longer had medical insurance (UnitedHealthcare) after leaving my previous full-time job to move to the area for school (nothern Virginia). The insurance cost for the 2018-2019 academic year is $1,970. I've taken out graduate loans and some of the loans are going toward covering that cost.

I got to thinking, though. Would it be more financially feasible for me to sign up for an individual plan? Would it be less expensive? I briefly checked quotes for UHC based on my personal information, and it shows a monthly premium of about $55. That seems it would be less costly and would allow me to allocate the loan money toward something more important. Furthermore, the deadline for waiving the student health insurance isn't until early October.

I know there's a lot of factors to consider here, like what benefits I have with the student health insurance and what the actual monthly cost would be for, say, an individual UHC plan.

I guess my question is, is it worthwhile to take the time to really make a good application? And if I plan on getting a PhD, should I just wait till next year when I am more competitive since I'll still have a long time to go yet? I am already funded through an RA and full tuition waiver.

Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8qutft/question_about_funds_for_thesis_project_canadian/,1,Funding varies by school and department. It wouldn’t hurt to ask your supervisor.  ,2018-06-13 18:33:37
767,8nlzg6,False,Finance,1,Are there any scholarships left to apply for?,GradSchool,"So I may be jumping the gun on this as I do not yet have an admission decision, but hopefully this will help other people if not me.  I have my master's in psychology, and about a month ago my grad school announced that they are starting a PhD program in my same department, with the first cohort starting in September.  They need a ""trial"" cohort to go through the program in order to gain accreditation from American Psychological Association, and brochure says the program will be free to this trial cohort.  

So I apply, and I got an interview.  Interview went ok, I left feeling it could go either way.  Since my interview I have found out that the program would not be totally free- I'd have to pay for roughly 4 credits per semester at least until I get done with classes (could be as little as one year since I got my master's from same school in same department).  My estimates come to about $4k per semester including tuition, fees, and books.  I don't know how their partial funding would work when it comes time to do dissertation.  Also, if I get accepted and do this, they will have a program rule that students cannot work more than 20 hours per week at our everyday jobs.

If I were to get in, does anyone have ideas for how I could come up with the $4k by September?  I work full-time now so I could haul ass and work a ton until then, but free money is always preferable so that I can save a ton to help with living expenses should I do this.  I've started doing google searches but so far most scholarships are already being given out.  I'd look into assistantships but that would mean quitting my current job, and I'd rather keep that since it's in the psych field.  Loans are not an option- already $140k in debt from undergrad and master's and I am NOT adding to that.  

Thanks in advance for any/all advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8nlzg6/are_there_any_scholarships_left_to_apply_for/,0,[deleted] ,2018-05-31 20:53:10
768,8oh5mi,False,Finance,0,Funding for international postgraduate students in Spain,GradSchool,"Hi all, 
Sorry for this dull question but I can't seem to get a clear answer on whether or not I can get a graduate loan (or grant.. if that still exists!) as an EU student studying on a masters course in Spain?  I'm thinking of the Erasmus+ loan in particular. Anyone out there have any recent experience of this? Or any experience of banks you've banked with in Spain as an international student would also be helpful.
